Why may that be true? If he was about the same age as Jesus or perhaps somewhat older, he would have been about 50 years old when he met with the other apostles in Jerusalem in the year 49&#160;C.E. (<a>Acts 15:7</a>) Some time after that meeting, Peter went to live in Babylon, doubtless to preach to the large population of Jews in that area. (<a>Gal. 2:9</a>) He was residing there when he wrote his first inspired letter, about 62&#160;C.E. Settling in a foreign land can be challenging, but Peter did not allow the fact that he was advancing in age to rob him of the joy of serving Jehovah fully. Today, many Christians in their 50’s and older find that their circumstances have changed and that they are able to serve Jehovah in new ways. Some have moved to where the need is greater. <a><i>w14</i> 1/15 4:9, 10</a></desc></text>

Similarly, the elders need to give prompt attention to any in the congregation who are suffering or require spiritual assistance. The elderly and the sick may need attention in connection with their physical needs, but they especially need spiritual help and encouragement. Young members of the congregation may be facing challenges, such as resisting “the desires incidental to youth.” (<a>2&#160;Tim. 2:22</a>) Shepherding thus involves visiting members of the congregation periodically with a view to understanding the situations they are facing and encouraging them with appropriate Scriptural counsel. When such issues are addressed in a timely fashion, many problems can be resolved before they ever become serious. <a><i>w13</i> 11/15 5:15</a></desc></text>

One way of doing this involves using our eyes and ears to learn more about Jehovah and his Son. Another important way of taking in knowledge of God is by experiencing the joyful feeling that comes from applying what we learn about him. The apostles had followed this life-giving process, for Jesus went on to pray: “The sayings that you gave me I have given to them, and they have received them.” (<a>John 17:8</a>) But to gain everlasting life, they needed to keep meditating on God’s sayings and to apply those sayings in their daily lives. Did the faithful apostles succeed in doing this to the end of their earthly lives? Indeed they did. Each of their individual names is indelibly written upon the 12 foundation stones of the heavenly New Jerusalem.—<a>Rev. 21:14</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 10/15 4:6</a></desc></text>

This can be especially challenging for those new in the truth or those just starting to make progress toward spiritual maturity. However, genuine progress is possible for such spiritual babes, as the Bible refers to them. Consider how an infant learns to walk without falling. The key to success usually lies in his taking small steps and doing so repeatedly. The same is true with a spiritual babe when it comes to making wise decisions. (<a>Heb. 5:13</a>) Recall that the apostle Paul described mature people as “those who through use have their perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong.” The words “through use” and “trained” both imply making continuous and repeated effort, and that is what new ones need to do. <a><i>w13</i> 9/15 4:11</a></desc></text>

The expression suggests that one can begin desiring something by simply looking at it. Note that Satan “showed [Jesus] all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth in an instant of time; and the Devil said to him: ‘I will give you all this authority and the glory of them.’” (<a>Luke 4:5,&#160;6</a>) Jesus would not with his literal eyes see all the kingdoms in an instant, but Satan must have felt that the glory of these kingdoms, as presented in a vision, would hold some attraction for Jesus. Shamelessly, Satan suggested: “If you do an act of worship before me, it will all be yours.” (<a>Luke 4:7</a>) In no way did Jesus want to be the kind of person Satan wanted him to be. His response was immediate. He said: “It is written, ‘It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.’”—<a>Luke 4:8</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 8/15 4:5,</a><a>&#160;9, 10</a></desc></text>

The first is over the domestics; the second is over all the master’s belongings. (<a>Matt. 24:45,</a><a>&#160;47</a>) Since the illustration is fulfilled only in this time of the end, both appointments would have to come after Jesus’ presence in kingly power began in 1914. At that time many groups claimed to be Christian. From which group would Jesus select and appoint the faithful slave? That question was answered after he and his Father came and inspected the temple, or spiritual arrangement for worship, from 1914 to the early part of 1919. (<a>Mal. 3:1</a>) They were pleased with a small band of loyal Bible Students who showed that their heart was with Jehovah and his Word. Jesus selected anointed brothers from among them to be the faithful and discreet slave and appointed them over his domestics. <a><i>w13</i> 7/15 4:2,</a><a>&#160;11, 12</a></desc></text>

Even though David was king, Jehovah did not hold back from giving him firm discipline. God sent his prophet Nathan to David with a strong message. (<a>2&#160;Sam. 12:1-12</a>) How did David respond? He was cut to the heart and repented. David became a recipient of God’s mercy. (<a>2&#160;Sam. 12:13</a>) In contrast, David’s predecessor, King Saul, did not respond well to counsel. (<a>1&#160;Sam. 15:1-3,</a><a>&#160;7-9,</a><a>&#160;12</a>) Saul should have let his heart be softened, allowing himself to be shaped by the Great Potter. (<a>Isa. 64:8</a>) Instead, Saul refused to be molded. He justified his behavior in sparing the livestock, rationalizing that the animals could be used as a sacrifice, and he minimized Samuel’s counsel. Jehovah rejected Saul as king, and Saul never recovered his good relationship with the true God.—<a>1&#160;Sam. 15:13-15,</a><a>&#160;20-23</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 6/15 4:3,</a><a>&#160;6, 7</a></desc></text>

They may tell you what you want to hear, but their advice may not help you at all. In fact, it could even harm you. Lacking the wisdom and experience of older ones, most young people do not have a long-term view of things and may not be able to discern the consequences of certain actions. Remember the example of King Solomon’s son Rehoboam. When he became the king of Israel, it would have been wise for him to follow the counsel of the older men. Instead, he followed the foolish advice of the younger men he had grown up with. He thus lost the support of most subjects of his kingdom. (<a>1&#160;Ki. 12:1-17</a>) Rather than imitating Rehoboam’s unwise course, work hard to keep the lines of communication with your parents open. Share your thoughts with them. Benefit from their counsel, and learn from their wisdom. <a><i>w13</i> 5/15 4:10</a></desc></text>

(<a>Heb. 10:24,&#160;25</a>) The primary purpose of our gathering together is to worship Jehovah. (<a>Ps. 95:6</a>) What a privilege we have to praise our wonderful God! (<a>Col. 3:16</a>) Jehovah deserves our regular worship through our attendance and participation at theocratic gatherings. (<a>Rev. 4:11</a>) It is no wonder, then, that we are exhorted ‘not to forsake the gathering of ourselves together, as some have the custom’! Do we see our Christian meetings as a provision to help us endure until Jehovah acts against this wicked system of things? If so, the meetings will be among “the more important things” that we make room for in our busy lives. It would have to be something extremely significant to cause us to miss an opportunity to be united with our brothers in worship of Jehovah. <a><i>w13</i> 4/15 4:7, 8</a></desc></text>

Regular house-to-house work on Sundays was organized in 1927. Supporters of the Kingdom were stimulated for greater activity in 1931 when they adopted the Scriptural name Jehovah’s Witnesses. (<a>Isa. 43:10,&#160;11</a>) In 1938, democratic elections of responsible men in the congregations were replaced by theocratic appointments. In 1972, congregation oversight was assigned to a body of elders instead of to one congregation overseer. All qualified men were encouraged to reach out to share in ‘shepherding the flock of God under their care.’ (<a>1&#160;Pet. 5:2</a>) In 1976, the Governing Body was organized into six committees to supervise the Kingdom work around the world. Fittingly, since 1914, Jehovah’s appointed King has progressively organized subjects of the Kingdom in a theocratic, or God-ruled, way. <a><i>w14</i> 1/15 2:12</a></desc></text>

In that same country, a building project was scheduled for a much needed Kingdom Hall. The local brothers and sisters wanted to assist. However, the project was to be undertaken in the middle of their planting season. Still determined to have a share, they worked on the Kingdom Hall project during the day and then planted their crops in the evening. What a self-sacrificing spirit! This reminds us of the brothers in first-century Macedonia. They were in “deep poverty,” yet they begged for the privilege of helping with the project at hand. (<a>2&#160;Cor. 8:1-4</a>) May each of us likewise ‘give in proportion to the blessing that Jehovah has given us.’ <a><i>w13</i> 12/15 2:15</a></desc></text>

They defend the flock by putting their brothers on guard against any who might attempt to undermine their faith. The apostle Peter warned of “false prophets” and “false teachers” who would try to “entice unsteady souls” into wrongdoing. (<a>2&#160;Pet. 2:1,</a><a>&#160;14</a>) Present-day elders must give similar warnings when necessary. As mature Christian men, they have experience in life. Further, before being appointed, they demonstrated that they had a clear understanding of the Scriptures and that they were qualified to teach what is healthful. (<a>1&#160;Tim. 3:2;</a><a>&#160;Titus 1:9</a>) Their maturity, balance, and Bible-based wisdom enable them to give skillful direction to the flock. <a><i>w13</i> 11/15 4:8</a></desc></text>

(<a>Isa. 1:16-19</a>) No matter what problem we may face, we can find comfort in knowing that Jehovah cares for us and wants to help us. In fact, he promises to provide us with the strength needed to keep on enduring. (<a>1&#160;Cor. 10:13</a>) If we are suffering some form of injustice—even as the faithful man Job did—we need to remind ourselves that Jehovah is not the cause of the unfairness. Jehovah hates injustice; he loves righteousness. (<a>Ps. 33:5</a>) May we, like Job’s friend Elihu, acknowledge: “Far be it from the true God to act wickedly, and the Almighty to act unjustly!” (<a>Job 34:10</a>) Rather than causing our problems, Jehovah gives us “every good gift and every perfect present.”—<a>Jas. 1:13,</a><a>&#160;17</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 8/15 2:16, 17</a></desc></text>

If so, before offering your prayer, spend a few moments thinking about what you want to say. Of course, Jehovah would never reject a sincere prayer of one of his loyal servants. But we do well to avoid getting into a rut when communicating with him. Obviously, our prayers cannot be superficial if we wish to draw close to God. The more we pour out our heart to Jehovah, the closer we will be to him and the more we will trust in him. What, though, should we include in our prayers? God’s Word answers: “In everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to God.” (<a>Phil. 4:6</a>) The fact is, anything that affects our relationship with God or our life as one of his servants is a proper subject of prayer. <a><i>w13</i> 9/15 2:7-9</a></desc></text>

Thus, the ‘shining brightly’ of the anointed must occur at that future time as well. Jesus also said that the righteous ones will ‘shine <i>in</i> the kingdom.’ What does that mean? All faithful anointed ones who are still on earth after the initial part of the great tribulation has passed will already have received their final sealing. Then, as indicated in Jesus’ prophecy about the great tribulation, they will be gathered to heaven. (<a>Matt. 24:31</a>) <i>There</i> they will shine <i>“in</i> the kingdom of their Father,” and shortly after the battle of Armageddon, they will share as Jesus’ joyous bride in “the marriage of the Lamb.”—<a>Rev. 19:6-9</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 7/15 2:16, 17</a></desc></text>

Can you listen to your children’s requests and, where appropriate, accede to their wishes? Parents may find that when they consider their children’s thoughts about house rules, the children are more inclined to understand the rules and to obey them. Congregation elders strive to imitate Jehovah’s reasonableness by taking into account the circumstances of their fellow believers. Recall that Jehovah valued even the sacrifices offered by poorer Israelites. Likewise, some brothers and sisters are very limited in what they can do in the ministry, perhaps because of health problems or advanced age. What if these dear ones feel disheartened because of their limitations? The elders can kindly reassure them that Jehovah loves them for giving their best.—<a>Mark 12:41-44</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 6/15 2:16,</a><a>&#160;18, 19</a></desc></text>

We may wonder how many were reconciled to God because of the courageous stand taken by Peter and the other apostles. (<a>Acts 5:17-28</a>) In our case, fellow students, workmates, or members of our family may respond favorably when they see the stand we take for what is right. At any given time, some of our brothers are experiencing persecution. For instance, in Armenia, approximately 40 brothers are in prison because of their neutrality. In Eritrea, 55 servants of Jehovah are imprisoned, some over 60 years of age. In South Korea, about 700 Witnesses are in prison for their faith. This situation has gone on there for 60 years.

Suppose a married couple asked a Christian elder for help to end their frequent arguments. What would the elder do? Without taking sides, he can reason with the couple on Bible principles, perhaps using those found in chapter&#160;3 of the book <i>The</i> <i>Secret</i> <i>of</i> <i>Family</i> <i>Happiness.</i> As the elder guides the discussion, the husband and wife may discern what counsel each should apply more fully. At a later time, the elder would want to inquire about how things are going in the family and offer more help if that is needed. By showing patience and kindness, we too can encourage those who are worried about their health, are downhearted after the loss of their employment, or are confused about certain Scriptural teachings.

That was quite a record for a modern-day monarch. As impressive as the length of King Sobhuza’s rule may be, there is a king whose reign is not limited by the short life span of humans. In fact, the Bible refers to him as “the King of eternity.” A psalmist identified this Sovereign by name, proclaiming: “Jehovah is King forever and ever.” (<a>Ps. 10:16</a>) The length of God’s reign makes his rule unlike that of any human. However, it is Jehovah’s way of ruling that draws us to him. A king who ruled over ancient Israel for 40 years praised God with these words: “Jehovah is merciful and compassionate, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love. Jehovah has firmly established his throne in the heavens; and his kingship rules over everything.” (<a>Ps. 103:8,</a><a>&#160;19</a>) Not only is Jehovah our King but he is also our Father—our loving, heavenly Father. <a><i>w14</i> 1/15 1:1, 2</a></desc></text>

Misleading statements and outright lies about Jehovah’s servants and their beliefs are sometimes featured in the media. Newspaper headlines, television documentaries, and Internet Web pages are used to propagate untruths. As a result, some people become disturbed, gullibly believing such lies.

(<a>Col. 1:15</a>) An initial step is to identify teachings that obscure the truth about Jehovah. Then we must skillfully use the Bible to overturn any reasonings that are “raised up against the knowledge of God.” (<a>2&#160;Cor. 10:4,&#160;5</a>) One false teaching that blinds people to the truth about God is the doctrine of evolution. This human reasoning contradicts the Bible and robs people of hope. In its basic form, the teaching of evolution asserts that all life came into existence spontaneously; it thus implies that human life has no purpose. <a><i>w13</i> 10/15 1:1, 2</a></desc></text>

Studying about God’s Kingdom, the ransom, the disciple-making work, and such qualities as love and faith is a regular part of our spiritual diet. By reviewing these subjects, we are helped to remain healthy in the faith and to “become doers of the word, and not hearers only.” (<a>Jas. 1:22</a>) The Hebrew noun rendered “reminder” often refers to laws, commands, and regulations that God gives to his people. Unlike human laws, which often need to be amended or updated, Jehovah’s laws and regulations are always trustworthy. Though some of them are given for a particular time or situation, they never become faulty or inadequate. <a><i>w13</i> 9/15 1:1, 2</a></desc></text>

In 1513&#160;B.C.E., the Israelites were eager to comply with Jehovah’s will. So God sanctified them, or set them apart as his chosen people. What a privilege that was! Forty years later, Moses reminded them: “You are a holy people to Jehovah your God.” (<a>Deut. 7:6</a>) Sadly, Israel’s initial enthusiasm about being a holy nation did not last long. Although there were always some individuals who served God, the Jews in general were often more concerned about appearing to be holy, or devout, than they were about doing God’s will. Like the Israelites, Witnesses of Jehovah today have been sanctified by God in a general sense. Both anointed Christians and those of the “great crowd” are holy, set apart for sacred service. (<a>Rev. 7:9,</a><a>&#160;14, 15;</a><a>&#160;1&#160;Cor. 6:11</a>) None of us want to lose our sanctified standing before God as the Israelites eventually did. <a><i>w13</i> 8/15 1:2-4</a></desc></text>

So just a few days before his death, four of his apostles asked him: “When will these things be, and what will be the sign of your presence and of the conclusion of the system of things?” (<a>Matt. 24:3;</a><a>&#160;Mark 13:3</a>) Jesus answered by means of an extensive prophecy, recorded in <a>Matthew chapters&#160;24 and</a><a>&#160;25</a>. In that prophecy, Jesus foretold many noteworthy events. His words have profound meaning for us because we too are keenly interested in knowing what the future holds. Through the years, Jehovah’s servants have prayerfully studied Jesus’ prophecy about the last days. They have sought to get a clearer understanding of the timing of the fulfillment of Jesus’ words. <a><i>w13</i> 7/15 1:1, 2</a></desc></text>

In fact, a list could be made of more than 40 different qualities of Jehovah. Just imagine what a treasure of fascinating facts about Jehovah’s personality is waiting to be discovered through our personal or family study! In what ways can we benefit from such a study? It can deepen our appreciation for our heavenly Father. In turn, the deeper our appreciation for Jehovah, the stronger our desire to draw close to him and to imitate him. (<a>Josh. 23:8;</a><a>&#160;Ps. 73:28</a>) Our appreciation may deepen gradually. To illustrate: Our appreciation for a new dish becomes deeper as we first smell its aroma, then savor each morsel of it, and finally prepare the dish ourselves. Similarly, we deepen our appreciation for a quality of Jehovah by getting acquainted with it, reflecting on it, and then imitating it in our own life. <a><i>w13</i> 6/15 1:1, 2</a></desc></text>

The first and foremost Evangelizer is Jehovah God. Immediately after the rebellion of our first parents, Jehovah announced the good news that the serpent—actually, Satan the Devil—will be destroyed. (<a>Gen. 3:15</a>) Throughout the centuries, Jehovah inspired faithful men to write down details about how his name will be cleared of reproach, how the damage caused by Satan will be undone, and how humans can regain the opportunities forfeited by Adam and Eve. Angels too are evangelizers. They themselves tell good news, and they assist others in spreading good news. (<a>Luke 1:19;</a><a>&#160;2:10;</a><a>&#160;Acts 8:26, 27,</a><a>&#160;35;</a><a>&#160;Rev. 14:6</a>) What about the archangel Michael?

They develop enduring friendships with others who also love and serve the true God. All of these are valid reasons to “delight in the law of God.” But there are even more benefits. What are some of them? The more you learn about Jehovah and his Son, the more your love for them and your fellow humans will grow. Having accurate Scriptural knowledge helps you to see how God will soon save obedient mankind from this dying system. You have a positive message of good news to share with people in your ministry.

He says, “Seeing the happiness and appreciation of the local brothers and sisters after they stand in their new Kingdom Hall or when they receive assistance after a natural disaster makes all the work and effort worthwhile.” Jehovah’s modern-day organization has always looked for opportunities to support Jehovah’s work. In 1904, Brother C.&#160;T.&#160;Russell wrote: “Each one is to consider himself as appointed by the Lord the steward of his own time, influence, money, etc., and each is to seek to use these talents to the best of his ability, to the Master’s glory.” Though we reap many blessings, it costs us something to make sacrifices to Jehovah.—<a>2&#160;Sam. 24:21-24</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 12/15 2:7, 8</a></desc></text>

The “Hearer of prayer” lovingly listens to our appeals for help. (<a>Ps. 65:2</a>) However, we should also endeavor to focus on other forms of prayer. These include those of praise, thanksgiving, and supplication. There are many reasons why our prayers to Jehovah should include words of praise. For instance, we are moved to praise him when we think of “his works of mightiness” and “the abundance of his greatness.” (<a>Ps. 150:1-6</a>) Why, the six verses of the 150th Psalm exhort us 13 different times to praise Jehovah! With deep reverence for God, the composer of another psalm sang: “Seven times in the day I have praised you because of your righteous judicial decisions.” (<a>Ps. 119:164</a>) Jehovah surely deserves to be praised. Therefore, should we not praise him in our prayers “seven times in the day,” that is, very often? <a><i>w13</i> 11/15 1:1,</a><a>&#160;3, 4</a></desc></text>

Higher education, with its emphasis on academic study, often produces graduates who have few or no practical skills, leaving them unprepared to deal with the realities of life. By contrast, Jehovah’s servants choose education that helps them to develop the necessary skills so that they can maintain a simple life of service to God. They take to heart the counsel Paul offered Timothy: “To be sure, it is a means of great gain, this godly devotion along with self-sufficiency. So, having sustenance and covering, we shall be content with these things.” (<a>1&#160;Tim. 6:6,</a><a>&#160;8</a>) Rather than acquiring secular degrees and titles after their names, true Christians focus on obtaining “letters of recommendation” by engaging as fully as possible in the field ministry.—<a>2&#160;Cor. 3:1-3</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 10/15 2:13</a></desc></text>

According to one study, over 40&#160;percent of our actions are not based on deliberate forethought but are the result of ingrained habits. For example, every morning you probably have to decide what clothes to wear. You might view this as a small thing, and you make your choice without much deliberation, especially if you are in a hurry. But it is important to think about whether what you put on befits your role as a servant of Jehovah. (<a>2&#160;Cor. 6:3,&#160;4</a>) When you shop for clothes, you may think about styles and trends but what about modesty and cost?

The Devil told her that in the very day of her eating from “the tree of the knowledge of good and bad,” she was “bound to be like God, knowing good and bad.” (<a>Gen. 2:17</a>) Satan thus suggested that Eve could gain independence from Jehovah. Pride was apparently a factor that caused her to accept the lie. She partook of the forbidden fruit, believing that she would not really die. How wrong she was! In contrast with Eve, Jesus set a wonderful example of humility. Satan tried to tempt him in another way, but Jesus rejected even the very thought of doing something dramatic that would put God to the test. That would have been an act of pride! Instead, Jesus’ reply was clear and direct: “It is said, ‘You must not put Jehovah your God to the test.’”—<a>Luke 4:9-12</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 8/15 4:11, 12</a></desc></text>

But whenever people visited him, he spoke to them about the Scriptures and strengthened them in the faith. Jehovah also appreciates what elderly ones can do in his service.

Knowing the greatest Person in the universe, however, involves much more than having a mental grasp of God’s qualities and purpose. Knowing Jehovah includes having a close bond of love with him and with fellow believers. “He that does not love,” explains the Bible, “has not come to know God.” (<a>1&#160;John 4:8</a>) Thus, knowing God includes being obedient to him.

And the prayer of faith will make the indisposed one well, and Jehovah will raise him up. Also, if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him.” (<a>Jas. 5:14,&#160;15</a>) Even if the spiritually ailing one does not “call the older men,” they should quickly come to his aid as soon as they become aware of his situation.

Jesus provided a principle that can help us to make the best use of that time. When sending out his disciples into the field, he told them the words recorded in today’s text. Why would Jesus give such instructions? One Bible scholar states: “Salutations among the Orientals did not consist, as among us, of a slight bow, or extension of the hand, but [were] performed by many embraces, and inclinations, and even prostrations of the body on the ground. All this required much time.” Jesus was not encouraging his followers to be rude. Rather, he was helping them see that they had a limited amount of time and that they needed to make the most of it to care for the more important things.

In a spiritual sense, overseers have the responsibility of protecting, nursing, and caring for the health of members of the congregation, especially those who have hurt themselves or who have fallen sick spiritually. (<a>Jas. 5:14,&#160;15</a>) Some of these individuals may have strayed from the flock and have stopped engaging in Christian activities.

The nation of Israel regularly received warnings through God’s prophets. For example, shortly before the Israelites were to enter the Promised Land, Moses warned them: “Watch out for yourselves for fear your heart may be enticed, and you do turn aside and worship other gods and bow down to them, and Jehovah’s anger does blaze against you.” (<a>Deut. 11:16,&#160;17</a>) The Bible reveals that God gave his people scores of helpful reminders.

In the larger fulfillment, the “standing” will occur when the United Nations (the modern-day “disgusting thing”) attacks Christendom (which is holy in the eyes of nominal Christians) and the rest of Babylon the Great.

On finding such phrases, verses, or accounts, read them slowly, perhaps forming the words with the tongue and lips. The full weight of a Scriptural point may strike you in a deeply personal way.

Would they be justified in questioning whether their activity is worth reporting? Even if you are not greatly restricted, you might feel that your efforts represent only a small part of all the hours that God’s people spend each year in worshipping him. Still, we learn from the account of the poor widow that Jehovah notices and treasures each act done for him, especially when done in the face of difficult circumstances. (<a>Luke 21:1-4</a>) Think back on your worship of Jehovah during the past year. Did one of the hours you devoted to him require a special sacrifice on your part? If so, you can be sure that he values what you did for him during that hour. When, like the needy widow, you are doing all you can in Jehovah’s service, you have solid reason for believing that you are “in the faith.” <a><i>w14</i> 3/15 2:5,</a><a>&#160;11</a></desc></text>

The Kingdom message became especially “good” in 1914. Since then, the message no longer concerns a future Kingdom but has to do with a real government now functioning in the heavens. This is the “good news of the Kingdom” that we preach “in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations.” (<a>Matt. 24:14</a>) Is our heart “stirred” by the Kingdom message? Do we preach the good news of the Kingdom with zeal? Like the psalmist, our “song is about a king”—our King Jesus Christ. We proclaim him as the enthroned heavenly King of the Messianic Kingdom. Moreover, we invite all—the rulers and the ruled—to submit to his kingship. (<a>Ps. 2:1, 2,</a><a>&#160;4-12</a>) And our tongue becomes like “the stylus of a skilled copyist” in that we make extensive use of the written Word in our preaching work. <a><i>w14</i> 2/15 1:3, 4</a></desc></text>

Instead, they chose to follow a rebellious spirit son of God, Satan. (<a>Gen. 3:1-6</a>) Life apart from God’s rule brought pain, suffering, and death to them and their offspring. (<a>Gen. 3:16-19;</a><a>&#160;Rom. 5:12</a>) God no longer had obedient subjects on the earth. Did this mean that he had lost control, that he had relinquished sovereignty over the earth and its inhabitants? Absolutely not! He exercised his authority by driving the man and woman out of the garden of Eden, and to prevent their return, he assigned cherubs to stand guard at the entrance. (<a>Gen. 3:23,&#160;24</a>) At the same time, God showed his fatherly love by confirming that his purpose to have a universal family of devoted spirit sons as well as human sons would be accomplished.

Concerning what may we supplicate Jehovah? We can certainly do so when we are being persecuted or if we are facing a life-threatening illness. At such times, our prayers for God’s help understandably become supplications. But are these the only times when we can supplicate Jehovah? Consider Jesus’ model prayer, and note what he said about God’s name, His Kingdom, and His will. (<a>Matt. 6:9,&#160;10</a>) This world is drenched in wickedness, and human governments are failing to care for even the basic needs of their citizens. Surely, then, we should pray for our heavenly Father’s name to be sanctified and for his Kingdom to rid the earth of Satan’s rule. This is also a time to supplicate Jehovah to have his will done on earth as it is in heaven. Let us therefore remain vigilant, readily making use of all forms of prayer. <a><i>w13</i> 11/15 1:3,</a><a>&#160;6, 7</a></desc></text>

For example, about two years before he died, Jesus made a weighty decision. He selected the first of the few through whom he would later feed the many. Consider what happened. After praying all night, Jesus gathered his disciples and from among them chose 12 apostles. (<a>Luke 6:12-16</a>) For the next two years, he was especially close to the 12, teaching them both by word and by example.

What do “all [Jesus’] belongings” include? Jesus did not qualify the word “all,” as if to limit his belongings to earthly things. In fact, Jesus has vast heavenly authority. “All authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth,” he said. (<a>Matt. 28:18;</a><a>&#160;Eph. 1:20-23</a>) His belongings now include the Messianic Kingdom, which has belonged to him since 1914 and which he will share with his anointed followers.—<a>Rev. 11:15</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 7/15 4:15-17</a></desc></text>

When the people of Nineveh repented and turned around from their bad way, Jehovah changed his mind, as shown in the words of today’s text. The Hebrew term translated “felt regret” actually pertains to a change of attitude or intention. The true God felt regret in the case of the Ninevites; that is, he changed his intention regarding them.

He said to his opposers: “I have come <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>name</i> <i>of</i> <i>my</i> <i>Father,</i> but you do not receive me; if someone else arrived in his own name, you would receive that one.” (<a>John 5:43</a>) Then, a few days before his death, Jesus expressed his main concern in life by praying: “Father, glorify your name.” (<a>John 12:28</a>) So we should not be surprised that Jesus weaves this concern for his Father’s name throughout the prayer recorded in <a>the 17th chapter of John</a>.

(<a>Phil. 2:8</a>) As followers of Jesus, we can display the spirit of self-sacrifice by being willing to give up our own interests in order to help others. In a sense, it is the opposite of selfishness. An unselfish spirit can help us to place our feelings and personal preferences after those of others. (<a>Phil. 2:3,&#160;4</a>) In fact, Jesus taught that an unselfish spirit is at the heart of our worship. How so?

The apostle Matthew was present and later wrote: “Jesus took a loaf and, after saying a blessing, he broke it and, giving it to the disciples, he said: ‘Take, eat.’” (<a>Matt. 26:26</a>) The “loaf” was unfermented bread, as was used for the Passover. (<a>Ex. 12:8;</a><a>&#160;Deut. 16:3</a>) The bread was made from wheat flour and water, without any leaven or seasoning.

However, that is contrary to fact. Jesus’ body was there in front of the faithful apostles, and so was the unleavened bread they would partake of. Clearly, Jesus was speaking symbolically, as he did many other times.

He said that those who would reign “in the kingdom of God” should partake of both the bread and the wine as <i>symbols</i> of his flesh and his blood. (<a>Mark 14:22-25</a>) So while the Passover was ‘to be a memorial for’ Jews, not Christians, we as Christians should know about it and take to heart some of the vivid lessons that it provides as part of ‘all Scripture that is inspired of God.’—<a>Ex. 12:14;</a><a>&#160;2&#160;Tim. 3:16</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 12/15 3:20, 21</a><b>Memorial</b> <b>Bible</b> <b>reading:</b>&#160;&#160;<b>(Daytime</b> <b>events:</b> <b>Nisan</b>&#160;<b>12)</b>&#160;&#160;<a><b>Matthew</b> <b>26:1-5,</b></a><a>&#160;<b>14-16;</b></a><a>&#160;<b>Luke</b> <b>22:1-6</b></a></desc></text>

The atmosphere, for example, does more than provide us with air to breathe. It also shields us from the majority of the debris that hurtles through space. Chunks of rock that could cause massive damage usually burn up on entering the earth’s atmosphere, creating beautiful bright streaks of light in the night sky. The earth’s magnetic field also protects us from harm. This shield originates deep inside the earth. The earth’s outer core, mostly made of molten iron, generates a powerful magnetic field that envelops us and stretches far into space. This field safeguards us from the radiation emanating from solar flares and explosions in the outer regions of the sun. Thanks to the earth’s magnetic field, these bursts of energy do not scorch all life on the surface of our globe. Instead, they are absorbed and deflected. <a><i>w13</i> 10/15 1:6, 7</a></desc></text>

Who should take the initiative in this? Note the example Jesus set.

How can that affect the congregation? An 88-year-old pioneer sister observed: “The warm smiles and encouraging comments I receive from the elders when I enter the Kingdom Hall endear them to me.” Another faithful sister added: “It may be viewed as a little thing, but when an elder welcomes me to the meeting with a smile, it means a lot to me.” <a><i>w13</i> 6/15 1:6,</a><a>&#160;8</a></desc></text>

(<a>Neh. 13:15-21</a>) One lesson is that we should limit our commercial interests. Otherwise, we might easily become distracted—or even divided in our affections—especially if we enjoy our secular work. Remember Jesus’ warning about slaving for two masters. (<a>Matt. 6:24</a>) Nehemiah had financial resources, but how did he use his time in Jerusalem? (<a>Neh. 5:14-18</a>) Instead of pursuing business contacts with the Tyrians or others, he devoted himself to helping his brothers and doing things that contributed to the sanctification of Jehovah’s name. Likewise today, Christian elders and ministerial servants focus on doing things for the benefit of the congregation, and their fellow believers love them for this spirit.

When you examine those verses, you will note that Jesus there foretells events that are similar to the ones he mentions in the parable of the sheep and the goats. For example, the Son of man comes with glory and with angels; all tribes and nations are gathered; those judged as sheep “lift [their] heads up” because “everlasting life” awaits them. Those judged as goats “beat themselves in lamentation,” realizing that “everlasting cutting-off” awaits them.—<a>Luke 21:28;</a><a>&#160;Matt. 25:33,</a><a>&#160;46</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 7/15 1:12</a></desc></text>

For example, when Jesus wanted to teach his disciples a lesson in humility, he first put a thought-provoking question to them. (<a>Mark 9:33</a>) To teach Peter how to reason on principles, Jesus asked him a multiple-choice question. (<a>Matt. 17:24-26</a>) On another occasion, when Jesus wanted to draw up what was in the heart of his disciples, he asked a series of viewpoint questions. (<a>Matt. 16:13-17</a>) By using questions and making statements, Jesus did more than impart facts. He touched hearts, motivating people to act in harmony with the good news. When we imitate Jesus by using questions effectively, we do at least three things. We discover how we can best help people, we overcome potential conversation stoppers, and we teach humble ones how they can benefit themselves. <a><i>w13</i> 5/15 1:10, 11</a></desc></text>

Therefore, make good use of the publications of Jehovah’s organization to do research. Or if you wonder how a certain Bible teaching might affect your life, you could ask a congregation elder or another mature Christian for help. Apollos was a Jewish Christian who had been teaching an out-of-date understanding of baptism. A Christian couple named Priscilla and Aquila explained “the way of God more correctly to him.” (<a>Acts 18:24-26</a>) Like Apollos, we strive to understand what we read in the Bible.

God also showed great love for his entire human family when he commissioned Noah to be “a preacher of righteousness.” (<a>2&#160;Pet. 2:5</a>) Noah’s message no doubt included a call for repentance and warnings of impending destruction, but it fell on deaf ears. For decades, Noah and his family lived amid a violent and grossly immoral world. Jehovah, as a caring Father, protected and blessed those eight loyal souls.

This merits our attention because the prevailing selfish spirit could rub off on us. (<a>Eph. 2:2</a>) Selfishness may be compared to rust that develops on iron. If an iron object is exposed to the elements, it might begin to rust. The real danger lies in ignoring the rust, allowing it to develop to the point of causing structural damage or failure.

In their study of the Scriptures, they found that the seventh month was to include the Festival of Booths with its concluding solemn assembly from the 15th through the 22nd day of Tishri, so they began to make preparations. It turned out to be the most successful Festival of Booths since the days of Joshua and resulted in “very great rejoicing.” An important feature of this festival was the public reading of God’s Law, “day by day, from the first day until the last day.”—<a>Neh. 8:12-18</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 10/15 3:3, 4</a></desc></text>

Thirty-three thousand of the prisoners from Sachsenhausen concentration camp were due to march 155&#160;miles (250&#160;km) to Lübeck, a port city in Germany. Among them were 230 of Jehovah’s Witnesses from six countries, who were ordered to march together. All had been weakened by starvation and disease.

(<a>Deut. 1:19;</a><a>&#160;Ex. 40:36-38</a>) He also provided for their basic needs. “Their very garments did not wear out, and their feet themselves did not become swollen.” (<a>Neh. 9:19,&#160;20</a>) God’s servants today are on the threshold of a righteous new world.

Unhesitatingly, they “continued devoting themselves to the teaching of the apostles.” According to one scholar, the Greek verb rendered “continued devoting themselves” can mean having “a steadfast and singleminded fidelity to a certain course of action.” The new believers had a deep hunger for spiritual food, and they knew exactly where to get it.

(<a>Rom. 8:38,&#160;39</a>) In what other ways does Jehovah demonstrate loyalty? He remains true to his standards. “Even to one’s old age I am the same,” he assures us. (<a>Isa. 46:4</a>) He always makes decisions based on his unchanging standards of right and wrong. (<a>Mal. 3:6</a>) In addition, Jehovah demonstrates loyalty by remaining faithful to his word of promise. (<a>Isa. 55:11</a>) Jehovah’s loyalty thus benefits all of his faithful worshippers. How so?

Women generally like to talk about their feelings, people, and relationships. They appreciate warm, intimate communication, for it reassures them that they are loved. On the other hand, many men are less inclined to discuss their feelings and are more likely to talk about activities, problems, and solutions. And men desire to be respected. An insightful husband takes note of his wife’s feelings and tries to adapt his approach accordingly. At the same time, he reassures her that her thoughts and feelings are important to him. (<a>1&#160;Pet. 3:7</a>) In turn, she tries to understand his viewpoint. When a husband and wife understand, appreciate, and fulfill their Scriptural roles, their union is a thing of beauty.

Elijah remained valuable in God’s eyes, and Jehovah took steps to assure him of that reality. God sent an angel to strengthen Elijah. Jehovah also provided food and drink that would sustain Elijah during his 40-day trip south to Mount Horeb. Moreover, God kindly corrected Elijah’s mistaken idea that no other Israelites had remained faithful to Jehovah. Significantly, God gave Elijah new assignments, which he accepted.

Think of how Jehovah communicated with his people during critical times in the past.

(<a>Ex. 12:1-7,</a><a>&#160;21-23,</a><a>&#160;29</a>) Very likely, you can think of numerous other occasions in Bible history when Jehovah provided life-saving instructions through human or angelic representatives. In all these cases, God saw fit to delegate authority. Messengers spoke in his name, and they told his people what they needed to do in order to survive a crisis. Can we not imagine that Jehovah might do something similar at Armageddon? Naturally, any elders today who are delegated the responsibility of representing Jehovah or his organization must be exceptionally careful never to abuse the authority entrusted to them. <a><i>w13</i> 11/15 4:14, 15</a></desc></text>

This was essential for them to complete the work that Jesus had started. For them to succeed in this lifesaving work, Jesus emphasizes three vital needs. First, he prays that his disciples be no part of Satan’s unholy world. Second, he prays that they may be sanctified, or kept holy, by applying to themselves the truth of God’s Word. Third, Jesus repeatedly begs that his disciples may be united in the same bond of love that exists between him and his Father. This calls for self-examination.

The Bible reminds us: “There exists a way that is upright before a man, but the ways of death are the end of it afterward.” (<a>Prov. 16:25</a>) Because of our imperfect nature, we humans do not have the full ability to determine what is truly beneficial for us to guide our steps perfectly. (<a>Prov. 28:26;</a><a>&#160;Jer. 10:23</a>) Also, the Bible shows that trends and standards of the world are manipulated and controlled by none other than Satan, “the god of this system of things.” (<a>2&#160;Cor. 4:4;</a><a>&#160;1&#160;John 5:19</a>) Therefore, if we want Jehovah’s blessing and approval, we need to heed the admonition found in today’s text. <a><i>w13</i> 9/15 3:2, 3</a></desc></text>

What does it mean to be impartial? It involves being fair, free from having or showing bias or favoritism. Genuine impartiality has two elements: attitude and actions. Why are both needed? Because only if someone <i>is</i> impartial in his outlook will he be moved to <i>treat</i> all with impartiality. In the Christian Greek Scriptures, the expression “not partial” literally means not a “taker of faces,” that is, not favoring one face over another. (<a>Acts 10:34</a>; <i>Kingdom</i> <i>Interlinear</i>) Hence, one who is impartial will pay due regard, not to an individual’s outward appearance or circumstances, but to his or her character as a person.

His Word states that he “is not partial” and that he “treats none with partiality.”—<a>Acts 10:34,&#160;35</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 6/15 1:11, 12</a></desc></text>

It helps us to see how important our preaching work is. Until the great tribulation begins, people still have time to change their thinking and start walking on the cramped road “leading off into life.” (<a>Matt. 7:13,&#160;14</a>) To be sure, people may now display a sheeplike or a goatlike disposition.

(<a>Mark 13:11</a>) Like King Solomon, pray to Jehovah for wisdom in carrying out theocratic responsibilities.

Nimrod is described as being “a mighty hunter in opposition to Jehovah.” He built great cities, such as Babel, and set himself up as a king “in the land of Shinar.” (<a>Gen. 10:8-12</a>) What action would the King of eternity take toward this rebel king and his efforts to thwart God’s purpose to “fill the earth”? (<a>Gen. 9:1</a>) God confused the people’s language, causing Nimrod’s frustrated subjects to be scattered “over the entire face of the earth.” They took their false worship and pattern of human rulership with them.—<a>Gen. 11:1-9</a>. <a><i>w14</i> 1/15 1:8,</a><a>&#160;10</a></desc></text>

Unmoved, Peter declared: “Even if I should have to die with you, I will by no means disown you.” (<a>Matt. 26:34,&#160;35</a>) Nevertheless, Peter did stumble, just as Jesus had foretold. Overwhelmed by his final denial of Jesus, Peter “wept bitterly.” (<a>Luke 22:60-62</a>) Peter certainly learned a lesson from this experience and overcame his tendency to be self-confident. Evidently, prayer helped Peter in this regard. In fact, it is noteworthy that the counsel to “be vigilant with a view to prayers” comes from Peter. (<a>1&#160;Pet. 4:7</a>) Are we heeding that inspired counsel? Furthermore, do we “pray continually” and thereby show our dependence on Jehovah? (<a>Matt. 26:41;</a><a>&#160;Ps. 85:8</a>) Let us also bear in mind the apostle Paul’s admonition: “Let him that thinks he is standing beware that he does not fall.”—<a>1&#160;Cor. 10:12</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 11/15 1:10, 11</a></desc></text>

What were “the traditions” that they had been taught? Certainly not those held by false religion and promoted as if they were as valuable as what is found in the Scriptures. Rather, Paul was referring to the teachings that he and others had received from Jesus as well as what God moved the apostle to transmit, much of which became part of the inspired Scriptures. Paul commended his brothers in the congregation in Corinth because, as he wrote, “in all things you have me in mind and you are holding fast the traditions just as I handed them on to you.” (<a>1&#160;Cor. 11:2</a>) Such teachings came from a reliable source and could indeed be trusted. <a><i>w13</i> 12/15 1:10</a></desc></text>

Consider the oxygen cycle. Billions of creatures take in oxygen and give off carbon dioxide. Even so, the supply of oxygen never runs out, and the atmosphere never becomes choked with the “waste” gas, carbon dioxide. Why not? The answer is found in an amazing process known as photosynthesis. Using this process, green vegetation takes in carbon dioxide, water, sunlight, and nutrients and produces carbohydrates and oxygen. When we take in oxygen, we complete the cycle. In a literal way, Jehovah uses the vegetation that he designed to give “to all persons life and breath.” (<a>Acts 17:25</a>) What remarkable wisdom! Jehovah’s brilliance is also revealed in the multitude of creatures that inhabit our remarkable planet. Estimates of the number of species on earth vary from 2&#160;million to 100&#160;million. (<a>Ps. 104:24</a>) Jehovah’s wisdom is evident in the design of them all. <a><i>w13</i> 10/15 1:5,</a><a>&#160;8-10</a></desc></text>

Have we made adjustments in order to follow these instructions? Doing so will help us to build the kind of faith that will preserve us alive into the new world. The directions that we have received will also help us with matters of everyday life. Examples include maintaining a balanced view of material things and keeping a simple eye in order to reduce anxiety. And we have benefited from guidance regarding our dress and grooming, choosing wholesome entertainment, and deciding on the appropriate amount of education. And think of the safety reminders we have received as to our homes, automobiles, Kingdom Halls, and preparing for possible emergencies.

Are you and your loved ones giving family worship, meeting attendance, and the field ministry first place in your lives? We may have to be resolute with our employer or business associates, especially if they do not respect our theocratic priorities, in order to give priority and proper attention to sacred things. We do well to ask ourselves, ‘Does the way I live demonstrate that I have been set apart for Jehovah’s service?’ <a><i>w13</i> 8/15 1:15</a></desc></text>

For example, notice how they handled a sensitive and potentially divisive issue that arose in the newly formed congregation. Ironically, the matter involved food—<i>material</i> food. Greek-speaking widows were being overlooked in the daily food distribution, but Hebrew-speaking widows were not being overlooked. How did the apostles resolve this delicate issue? “The twelve” appointed seven qualified brothers to oversee the “necessary business,” the food distribution. The apostles—most of whom had no doubt shared in distributing food to the crowds whom Jesus had miraculously fed—saw that it was more important for them to focus on <i>spiritual</i> feeding. Thus, they devoted themselves to “the ministry of the word.”—<a>Acts 6:1-6</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 7/15 3:7,</a><a>&#160;9</a></desc></text>

One way is by taking action in behalf of those who are facing difficult circumstances. (<a>Prov. 3:27</a>) For example, do you know of a fellow believer who is discouraged, perhaps because of health problems, family opposition, or personal failings? Why not take the initiative to offer that person some “good words, comforting words”? (<a>Zech. 1:13</a>) Doing so, you are proving yourself to be a loyal and true friend. (<a>Prov. 18:24</a>) We can also imitate Jehovah’s loyalty by remaining true to those whom we love. For example, if we are married, we know that we must stay faithful to our marriage mate. (<a>Prov. 5:15-18</a>) So we do not take even the first step down a path that could lead to adultery. (<a>Matt. 5:28</a>) In addition, we show loyalty to our fellow believers by shunning hurtful gossip or slander, refusing to spread such negative talk or even to listen to it.—<a>Prov. 12:18</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 6/15 3:4,</a><a>&#160;7, 8</a></desc></text>

Our conversations are much smoother as a result.” Discerning wives also speak graciously, aware that a well-chosen word “spoken at <i>the</i> <i>right</i> <i>time</i> <i>for</i> <i>it”</i> is both appealing and appreciated. (<a>Prov. 25:11</a>) A Christian husband should do his part not only by listening to what his wife says but also by striving to express his own feelings clearly. Also helpful is the right setting, perhaps when the couple are alone considering the day’s text or reading the Bible together. Important for both husband and wife are prayer and a strong desire to improve their communication skills. <a><i>w13</i> 5/15 3:6-8</a></desc></text>

For example, he did not provide details about how the brain works or how the universe functions, even though such information would have been very fascinating! Rather, Jehovah provided information that we need in order to understand his purposes and to live our lives in harmony with them. (<a>2&#160;Tim. 3:16,&#160;17</a>) How interesting, then, that the Bible does provide glimpses of the invisible part of Jehovah’s organization! We thrill at reading the descriptions of Jehovah’s heavenly arrangement written by Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel and in John’s Revelation account. (<a>Isa. 6:1-4;</a><a>&#160;Ezek. 1:4-14,</a><a>&#160;22-24;</a><a>&#160;Dan. 7:9-14;</a><a>&#160;Rev. 4:1-11</a>) It is as if Jehovah pulled back a curtain and allowed us to peer into the heavens.

He wrote: “In those days ten men out of all the languages of the nations will take hold .&#160;.&#160;. of the robe of a Jew, saying: ‘We want to go with you, for we have heard that God is with you people.’” (<a>Zech. 8:23</a>) At <a>Psalm 45:12</a>, these symbolic “ten men” are spoken of as “the daughter of Tyre” and “the wealthiest of men.” They come to the anointed remnant with gifts, ‘seeking their favor’ and spiritual help. Since 1935, millions of people have allowed the remnant to ‘bring them to righteousness.’ (<a>Dan. 12:3</a>) These loyal companions of the anointed Christians have purified their lives, becoming spiritual virgins. These “virgin companions” of the anointed have dedicated themselves to Jehovah and have proved themselves to be faithful subjects of the Bridegroom-King.—<a>Ps. 45:14</a>. <a><i>w14</i> 2/15 2:14</a></desc></text>

It is usually wise to have a family meeting to discuss cooperation, needs, and strategies. All involved, especially the parents, should express their feelings openly and address the facts realistically. They might discuss whether with additional help the parents can safely remain in their own home. Or they might consider how each relative’s strengths can be used to attend to such matters as giving day-to-day care or providing financial assistance. (<a>Prov. 24:6</a>) All should realize that everyone has a role; however, that role may change as time goes on and some rotation of duties may have to be considered. <a><i>w14</i> 3/15 4:3</a></desc></text>

Moses, for example, had all the opportunities of the royal court, while other Hebrews were slaves. (<a>Ex. 1:13, 14;</a><a>&#160;Acts 7:21,&#160;22</a>) Yet, Moses made the right choice.

As the young king ascended the throne, what would his priority be? To shore up Judah’s ailing economy? No. Hezekiah was a spiritual man, a worthy shepherd of his national flock. His first act was to reestablish pure worship and to reinforce the wayward nation’s frayed relationship with Jehovah. When he understood God’s will for him, Hezekiah acted decisively. (<a>2&#160;Chron. 29:1-19</a>) He invited all of Judah and Israel to a great Passover celebration. (<a>2&#160;Chron. 30:25,&#160;26</a>) What an inspiration that proved to be for all the people!

(<a>Neh. 9:1-4</a>) No doubt, their frequent reading of God’s Law helped the Levites to prepare this meaningful prayer. The first ten verses focus exclusively on Jehovah’s works and qualities. In the remaining part of the prayer, God’s “abundant mercy” is repeatedly highlighted along with a clear admission that the Israelites were not worthy of such kind treatment. (<a>Neh. 9:19,</a><a>&#160;27, 28,</a><a>&#160;31</a>) Our prayers to Jehovah will also be fresh and meaningful if, like those Levites, we daily meditate on God’s Word, allowing Jehovah to speak to us before we pray at length to him. (<a>Ps. 1:1,&#160;2</a>) The prayer contains only one modest request. (<a>Neh. 9:32</a>) Thus, the Levites set a good example for us to praise and thank Jehovah first before making personal requests in our prayers. <a><i>w13</i> 10/15 3:5-7</a></desc></text>

To them, religion consisted mainly of rituals—for births, marriages, and funerals—that were part of their social order. All of that posed a challenge for the Christians in Rome. Many of them came from that background, so they obviously needed to be transformed in order to become true Christians, and the transformation would not have ended on the day of their baptism. Like the Roman world, the world today is also a threat to Christians. Why? Because the spirit of the world is manifest in many ways. (<a>Eph. 2:2,&#160;3;</a><a>&#160;1&#160;John 2:16</a>) Exposed to the world’s desires, thinking, values, and morals day in and day out, we are in constant danger of being absorbed by the world.

Added to this are the stresses of day-to-day life.

Consider the case of a brother who over many decades had helped scores of people spiritually. In his later years, he and his wife experienced ill health, and he began to feel very discouraged.

(<a>John 10:16</a>) Jesus indicated that he would be with his disciples “all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.” (<a>Matt. 28:20</a>) In order to remain united and safe within the flock of God, we need to listen to ‘a word behind us,’ telling us which way to go. This “word” includes what God’s holy spirit says as expressed through the Bible and what Jehovah and Jesus say through those whom they have appointed as undershepherds. (<a>Rev. 3:22</a>) Satan is said to be walking about “like a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone.” (<a>1&#160;Pet. 5:8</a>) Like a wild and ravenous predator, he is stalking the flock, waiting for an opportunity to pounce on the unwary or on those who stray. That is all the more reason why we should stay very close to the rest of the flock and to “the shepherd and overseer of [our] souls.”—<a>1&#160;Pet. 2:25</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 11/15 4:16, 17</a></desc></text>

The same is true regarding our relationship with Jehovah God. As a shepherd, David spent many a night gazing at the starry heavens and meditating on their incomparable Creator. He wrote: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man that you keep him in mind, and the son of earthling man that you take care of him?” (<a>Ps. 8:3,&#160;4</a>) As we share in the ministry, we think and talk about Jehovah. That in itself has positive effects. Many who are able to engage in the full-time ministry have found that one blessing that results from their increased share in Kingdom service is that it has deepened their love for God. Yes, discussing future Kingdom blessings with others draws us closer to Jehovah. <a><i>w13</i> 9/15 5:1-3</a></desc></text>

Jehovah values our devotion and faithfulness to him; he does not measure us by our accomplishments. And it could well be that you have accomplished more for Jehovah than you realize.

View each assignment from Jehovah as proof that he is with you. (<a>Jer. 20:11</a>) You might be discouraged because your service seems fruitless or because some spiritual goal seems unattainable. Yet, you still share the greatest privilege that any of us can now have—that of preaching the good news and bearing God’s name. Remain faithful. Then, in a sense, the words in one of Jesus’ parables can be said to you: “Enter into the joy of your master.”—<a>Matt. 25:23</a>. <a><i>w14</i> 3/15 2:17, 18</a></desc></text>

The children of these foreign women could not read or speak Hebrew. When they got older, would they identify themselves as Israelites? Or would they rather think of themselves as Ashdodites, Ammonites, or Moabites? Without knowing the Hebrew language, was it likely that they would be able to understand God’s Law? How could they get to know Jehovah and choose to serve him instead of the false gods their mothers worshipped? Swift and decisive action was needed, and Nehemiah took such action.—<a>Neh. 13:28</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 8/15 1:16</a></desc></text>

There, Jesus makes eight references to his “coming,” or arrival. Regarding the great tribulation, he states: “They will see the Son of man <i>coming</i> on the clouds.” “You do not know on what day your Lord is <i>coming.”</i> “At an hour that you do not think to be it, the Son of man is <i>coming.”</i> And in his parable of the sheep and the goats, Jesus states: “The Son of man <i>arrives</i> in his glory.” (<a>Matt. 24:30,</a><a>&#160;42,</a><a>&#160;44;</a><a>&#160;25:31</a>) Each of these four references applies to Christ’s future coming as Judge.

Genuine impartiality has two aspects: attitude and actions. Only if we <i>are</i> impartial will we <i>treat</i> others without partiality. Yet, it is not always easy to evaluate our own feelings objectively. So, what could we do to find out if we are known as being unbiased? Well, when Jesus was interested in knowing what people were saying about him, he asked his trusted friends: “Who are men saying the Son of man is?” (<a>Matt. 16:13,&#160;14</a>) Why not follow Jesus in that? You could ask some friend whom you can count on for candor whether you have a reputation for being impartial. If he or she concedes that there seem to be some lingering traces of racial, social, or economic partiality, what should you do? Pray earnestly to Jehovah about your feelings, begging him to help you adjust your attitude so that it will reflect his impartiality to a fuller degree.—<a>Matt. 7:7;</a><a>&#160;Col. 3:10,&#160;11</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 6/15 1:11,</a><a>&#160;16</a></desc></text>

If we do so, however, we could stunt the spiritual growth of the student. Why? Because a student who repeats answers without meditating on them is unlikely to grow deep spiritual roots. He could easily end up being like a plant that withers under the heat of opposition. (<a>Matt. 13:20,&#160;21</a>) To help avoid that outcome, we need to ask our student how he feels about what he is learning. Try to discover if he agrees with the points made. More important, have him say why he agrees or disagrees. Then help him to reason on the Scriptures so that he will eventually be able to arrive at correct conclusions by himself. If we use questions effectively, individuals we teach are more likely to be solidly rooted in the faith and to be able to resist the efforts of those who would oppose or mislead them.—<a>Col. 2:6-8</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 5/15 1:16</a></desc></text>

Similarly, a Christian’s figurative heart requires shielding from the power of sin. What happens when a servant of Jehovah couples strong faith in God’s promises with love for Him and for fellow humans? Such a servant puts on a spiritual breastplate of the highest quality. It is unlikely that he will do anything to lose God’s favor. Paul also mentioned a helmet, “the hope of salvation.” With a good helmet, a soldier in Bible times could survive blows to the head without suffering serious injury. We build hope in Jehovah’s saving acts by studying his Word. Strong hope enables us to resist apostates and their gangrenous “empty speeches.” (<a>2&#160;Tim. 2:16-19</a>) Our hope will also strengthen us to say no to those who would lead us into conduct condemned by Jehovah. <a><i>w13</i> 4/15 1:17, 18</a></desc></text>

First to go will be Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion. It is Jehovah’s purpose to use the political rulers to destroy this wicked “prostitute.” (<a>Rev. 17:16,&#160;17</a>) Next, the Warrior-King will proceed against Satan’s political system, bringing it to nothing.

Did this mean that Jehovah would not fulfill his promise or that he had relinquished his sovereignty over the earth? Not at all! In his due time, Jehovah demonstrated his divine power and expressed his sovereignty over stubborn Pharaoh. The enslaved Israelites put their faith in Jehovah, who delivered them in a grand way through the Red Sea.

Any one of these activities could distract a Christian and weaken his zeal. The result? Heartfelt prayer, study of God’s Word, meeting attendance, and preaching the good news might suffer. On the other hand, daily reading and regular study of God’s Word will help us to focus on where we are in the stream of time—keeping us aware that we are in “the last days.”—<a>2&#160;Pet. 3:3,&#160;4</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 12/15 1:11-13</a></desc></text>

If we are dealing with illness or are struggling with depression, for instance, we may begin to feel that the time we spend in the ministry each month means very little to God. Some of us may experience distressing thoughts, perhaps because of past experiences in life. Satan would have us believe that we are worthless. His attacks are often designed to play on our emotions and thus weaken our faith. When confronted with tests and trials, let us remember the example of Nehemiah and immediately turn to God in prayer.

Genuine love grows as a loyal couple experience life together, with its joys and challenges. They become even closer friends and cherish each other’s company. Such marriages are nourished, not by just a few great deeds, as portrayed in the media, but by countless smaller acts—a hug, a kind remark, a thoughtful gesture, a telling smile, or a sincere “how was your day?” These <i>little</i> things can make a <i>big</i> difference in a marriage. Love also impels a couple to continue learning about each other. (<a>Phil. 2:4</a>) In turn, such knowledge makes their love grow even stronger despite their imperfections. A successful marriage is not static but grows richer and stronger with time. So if you are married, ask yourself: ‘How well do I know my mate?

He puts away false religious practices and undesirable traits of his former way of life and cultivates the Christlike personality. (<a>Eph. 4:22-24</a>) We are happy to see hundreds of thousands make such progress each year and become qualified to get baptized in symbol of their dedication to Jehovah God. This, to be sure, makes Jehovah’s heart glad. (<a>Prov. 27:11</a>) However, are these changes all that are needed? Actually, being transformed involves more than making progress or improving. A note in <i>Vine’s</i> <i>Expository</i> <i>Dictionary</i> explains: “In Rom[ans] 12:2 being outwardly conformed to the things of this age [or system of things] is contrasted with being transformed (or transfigured) inwardly by the renewal of the thoughts through the Holy Spirit’s power.” <a><i>w13</i> 9/15 3:9, 10</a></desc></text>

Not really. We, of course, want to be careful to ‘mind our own business’ and not to ‘meddle in other people’s affairs.’ (<a>1&#160;Thess. 4:11;</a><a>&#160;1&#160;Tim. 5:13</a>) Nevertheless, if we want to encourage our brothers, we truly need to get to know them—their situation in life, their qualities, their spirituality, their strengths, and their weaknesses. They need to view us as their friends and be assured of our love for them. This requires spending time with them—not just when they face problems and get discouraged but at other times too.—<a>Rom. 12:13</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 8/15 3:4, 5</a></desc></text>

As the Head of the congregation, Christ used this small group of qualified men to settle doctrinal issues and to oversee and direct the preaching and teaching of the Kingdom good news. (<a>Acts 15:6-29;</a><a>&#160;21:17-19;</a><a>&#160;Col. 1:18</a>) Did Jehovah bless the arrangement by means of which his Son fed the first-century congregations? Most definitely! How can we be sure? The book of Acts gives us this report: “Now as they [the apostle Paul and his traveling companions] traveled on through the cities they would deliver to those there for observance the decrees that had been decided upon by the apostles and older men who were in Jerusalem. Therefore, indeed, the congregations continued to be made firm in the faith and to increase in number from day to day.”—<a>Acts 16:4,&#160;5</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 7/15 3:10, 11</a></desc></text>

So the more we bring our thoughts and feelings into harmony with Jehovah’s thoughts and feelings, the more we will be inclined to obey his commands. (<a>Ps. 119:104</a>) Granted, it will not always be easy to obey Jehovah’s commands. We may have to struggle to remain loyal. For instance, some single Christians would like to be married, but they have yet to find a suitable mate among worshippers of Jehovah. (<a>1&#160;Cor. 7:39</a>) A single sister might see that her unbelieving coworkers are always trying to introduce her to some potential mate. The sister might be battling feelings of loneliness. Still, she puts forth determined effort to maintain her integrity to Jehovah. Do we not appreciate such sterling examples of loyalty? Surely Jehovah will reward all who remain faithful to him despite difficulties.—<a>Heb. 11:6</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 6/15 3:9, 10</a></desc></text>

And what a blessed privilege it is to be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. To hold fast to our wonderful inheritance of everlasting life, though, we must remain alert to Satan’s ploys. Satan has always tried to influence God’s people to make choices that could cost them their inheritance. (<a>Num. 25:1-3,</a><a>&#160;9</a>) Aware that his end is near, Satan has stepped up his efforts to mislead us. (<a>Rev. 12:12,</a><a>&#160;17</a>) If we are to keep on ‘standing firm against the machinations of the Devil,’ we must continue to value our inheritance highly. <a><i>w13</i> 5/15 5:4, 5</a></desc></text>

He was “oppressed,” suffering great physical or emotional distress, and he lacked the strength to deal with his problems. (<a>Ps. 102</a>, superscription) We find in his words an indication that he was absorbed in his pain, loneliness, and personal feelings. (<a>Ps. 102:3, 4,</a><a>&#160;6,</a><a>&#160;11</a>) He believed that Jehovah wanted to cast him aside. (<a>Ps. 102:10</a>) As we see from <a>Psalm 102</a>, even those who are in the faith can be in pain and be struggling to focus on anything else. The psalmist felt “like a solitary bird on a roof,” as if he had only his troubles for company. (<a>Ps. 102:7</a>) If you ever feel that way, pour out your heart to Jehovah as the psalmist did. The prayers of the oppressed one—your prayers—can help you as you battle negative thoughts. Jehovah promises that “he will pay attention to the prayer of the destitute; he will not despise their prayer.” (<a>Ps. 102:17</a>) Trust that promise. <a><i>w14</i> 3/15 2:19, 20</a></desc></text>

For example, Ezekiel saw the invisible part of Jehovah’s organization depicted by a colossal celestial chariot. This chariot could move swiftly and change direction in an instant. (<a>Ezek. 1:15-21</a>) With each revolution of its wheels, the chariot could cover great distances. In vision, Ezekiel was also able to get a glimpse of the Rider of the chariot. He said: “I got to see something like the glow of electrum, like the appearance of fire all around .&#160;.&#160;. It was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah.” (<a>Ezek. 1:25-28</a>) How awe-inspiring it must have been for Ezekiel to see this vision! He saw Jehovah in full control of his organization, directing its movement through his holy spirit. What an amazing representation of the heavenly part of Jehovah’s organization on the move! <a><i>w13</i> 4/15 3:6</a></desc></text>

As recorded in <a>Psalm 15</a>, David sang about what is required for us to be ‘a guest in Jehovah’s tent,’ that is, to be a friend of God. Two of these requirements are avoiding slander and acting honestly in all our dealings. David said of such a guest: “He does not slander with his tongue .&#160;.&#160;. He does not accept a bribe against the innocent.” (<a>Ps. 15:3,</a><a>&#160;5</a>) In another psalm, David warned: “Guard your tongue from what is bad.” (<a>Ps. 34:13</a>) Failure to heed this inspired counsel would create a gap between us and our righteous heavenly Father. In fact, slander is a characteristic of Jehovah’s great enemy, Satan. The term “Devil” is derived from a Greek word meaning “slanderer.” Controlling what we say about others helps preserve closeness with Jehovah. Especially is this true of our attitude regarding appointed men in the congregation.—<a>Heb. 13:17;</a><a>&#160;Jude&#160;8</a>. <a><i>w14</i> 2/15 4:10, 11</a></desc></text>

These developments are depicted by the ride of three horsemen closely following Jesus Christ. (<a>Rev. 6:3-8</a>) As foretold, peace was ‘taken away from the earth.’ World War&#160;I can be viewed as just the beginning of significant wars, as is proved by recent world developments. And despite many economic and scientific advances since 1914, food shortages continue to threaten world security. Furthermore, who can deny that all kinds of pestilences, natural disasters, and other ‘deadly plagues’ continue to cut down millions of victims each year? The scope, frequency, and severity of these events are unprecedented in human history. Do you take to heart the meaning of that? <a><i>w14</i> 1/15 5:4, 5</a></desc></text>

People in the world have no reliable guidance to help them achieve success and happiness. Most worry about the future and have no hope. They search for the meaning of life. Even most who are religious have little knowledge of the Scriptures. They are much like the people of ancient Nineveh. (<a>Jonah 4:11</a>) When we have an increased share in the ministry, we see more clearly the contrast between the spiritual condition of those to whom we preach and that of Jehovah’s people. (<a>Isa. 65:13</a>) We are reminded of Jehovah’s goodness in that he does more than provide for our spiritual needs; he invites all to receive spiritual refreshment and a real hope. <a><i>w13</i> 9/15 5:4</a></desc></text>

Because those who had the responsibility of teaching the people God’s Law were harsh, demanding, and hypocritical. Rather than helping and nurturing members of their flock, Israel’s spiritual leaders put “heavy loads” on their shoulders. (<a>Matt. 23:4</a>) Present-day Christian shepherds—the appointed elders—thus have a serious responsibility. The sheep in the flock they tend belong to Jehovah and to Jesus, who identified himself as “the fine shepherd.” (<a>John 10:11</a>) The sheep have been “bought with a price” that Jesus paid with his own “precious blood.” (<a>1&#160;Cor. 6:20;</a><a>&#160;1&#160;Pet. 1:18,&#160;19</a>) He loves the sheep so much that he willingly sacrificed his life for them.

Above all, pour out your heart to Jehovah. He can give you the peace of mind you need to deal with any situation. (<a>Ps. 55:22;</a><a>&#160;Prov. 24:10;</a><a>&#160;Phil. 4:6,&#160;7</a>) Some older ones and their families wisely collect information ahead of time about care options—such as the practicality of a parent living with a son or a daughter, making use of assisted living facilities, or taking advantage of other possibilities available locally.

(<a>Matt. 28:19,&#160;20</a>) Acting on his direction calls on us to be zealous in the preaching work. Can you imagine that your brothers in Thessalonica would have been content to preach and teach in a perfunctory manner, as if it were a mere duty to be performed listlessly?

The weeds overgrow the wheat, but the farmer orders his slaves to “let both grow together until the harvest.” During harvest season, the weeds are destroyed and the wheat is gathered. (<a>Matt. 13:24-30</a>) The events taking place in that farmer’s field illustrate how and when Jesus would gather out of mankind the entire wheat class—anointed Christians who will rule with him in his Kingdom. The sowing began at Pentecost 33&#160;C.E. The gathering will be complete when the anointed who are alive at the end of this system of things receive their final sealing and then are taken to heaven. (<a>Rev. 7:1-4</a>) This parable gives us a panoramic view of developments that would occur during a period of some 2,000 years.

(<a>Gal. 2:10;</a><a>&#160;Jas. 1:27</a>) Further, in the Kingdom-preaching work, we share the good news impartially with people of all backgrounds, including those from foreign countries. How happy we are that we have access to Bible literature in some 600 languages. What a tangible proof of impartiality! Indeed, as we take time to reflect on how approachable and impartial Jehovah is, our appreciation for him deepens. Deepened appreciation, in turn, ought to move us to imitate Jehovah’s qualities to the full, demonstrating them in all our dealings. <a><i>w13</i> 6/15 1:12,</a><a>&#160;17, 18</a></desc></text>

Your unrestrained enthusiasm might discourage your partner and confuse the householder. At times, it may be appropriate to join in the discussion. But if you choose to say something, limit yourself to a brief comment or two. Then allow your partner to resume the lead. How can you and your partner assist each other while walking from door to door? Why not use the time to discuss ways that your presentation might be improved? Be careful that your comments about those living in your territory are not discouraging. Likewise, avoid the trap of harping on the negative traits of fellow evangelizers.

Consider three reasons. First, Jesus stated that this preaching work would take his disciples “to the most distant part of the earth.” (<a>Acts 1:8</a>) Second, arrangements would be needed to provide spiritual food and to care for those engaged in this work. (<a>John 21:15-17</a>) Third, provisions would have to be made so that those preaching the good news could gather together to worship Jehovah and be taught how to carry out the work. (<a>Heb. 10:24,&#160;25</a>) Accomplishing these goals could not be done by accident. For Christ’s followers to be successful, the work would need to be well-organized.

One way is by always putting our confidence in the ones whom Jehovah and Jesus are trusting to lead us in our preaching work. <a><i>w13</i> 4/15 3:9-11</a></desc></text>

In what amounted to an effort to protect himself, Peter disowned Jesus three times. (<a>Matt. 26:69-75</a>) Despite his struggles and failures, Peter’s life is a heartening example. With personal effort and the help of God’s holy spirit, Peter was able to overcome his misguided tendencies and display self-control and self-sacrificing love. (<a>Gal. 5:22,&#160;23</a>) He endured trials that could be viewed as more severe than the ones he stumbled over earlier. He showed humility by how he reacted to a public rebuke from the apostle Paul.

Now the time has come for Jehovah’s anointed King to ride forth to establish the truth of Jehovah’s sovereignty once and for all.

During this joyous occasion, the Levites sang a song of praise that contained a noteworthy statement, as mentioned in today’s text. One might wonder, ‘Since Jehovah <i>is</i> the King of eternity, how is it that he <i>became</i> King at that time?’ Jehovah <i>becomes</i> King when he expresses his rulership or establishes an agency to represent him at a certain time or to deal with a specific situation. This aspect of Jehovah’s kingship has far-reaching significance. Before David died, Jehovah promised him that his kingship would continue indefinitely: “I will raise up your offspring after you, your own son, and I will firmly establish his kingdom.” (<a>2&#160;Sam. 7:12,&#160;13</a>) This “offspring” of David, Jesus the Messiah, appeared more than 1,000 years later. <a><i>w14</i> 1/15 1:13, 14</a></desc></text>

He was referring to the command to love. It was “old” in the sense that Jesus had given it decades earlier, “from the beginning.” But it was also “new” in that it called for self-sacrificing love, which the disciples might need as they faced new circumstances. As disciples of Christ, do we not appreciate warnings that help us to guard against developing the selfish spirit so characteristic of this world, which can erode our love of neighbor? <a><i>w13</i> 9/15 1:14</a></desc></text>

But as used in the Bible, it includes our mental inclination, attitude, and power of reason. Earlier in his letter to the Romans, Paul described people who reflected “a disapproved mental state.” Such ones were given to “unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, badness, being full of envy, murder, strife, deceit,” and other hurtful things. (<a>Rom. 1:28-31</a>) Sadly, we are surrounded by people in the world who fit Paul’s description. For us not to be fashioned, or molded, by the world any longer, we need to make an honest appraisal of our innermost attitudes and feelings, our goals, and our values. Such things may be hidden from public view. Others may tell us that we are doing well.

Your power will be scanty.” The words of a deeply discouraged person may become “wild talk.” (<a>Job 6:2,&#160;3</a>) In dealing with such ones, we need to keep in mind that what they say may not be a true reflection of what they really are at heart. Rachelle, whose mother became severely depressed, learned this from personal experience. Rachelle says: “Many times Mom would say something very hateful. Most of these times, I tried to remind myself of the kind of person Mom <i>really</i> is—loving, kind, and generous. I learned that depressed people say many things they do not mean.

When Jehovah forgives, he does so “in a large way”; he forgives both <i>completely</i> and <i>permanently.</i> (<a>Isa. 55:7</a>) How do we know that Jehovah forgives <i>completely?</i> Consider the assurance found at <a>Acts 3:19</a>. There the apostle Peter urged his listeners to “repent .&#160;.&#160;. and turn around.” When a sinner genuinely repents, he deeply regrets his wrong course. He is also determined not to repeat his sin. (<a>2&#160;Cor. 7:10,&#160;11</a>) Moreover, true repentance moves a sinner to “turn around,” abandoning his wrong course and pursuing a course that is pleasing to God. If Peter’s listeners would manifest such genuine repentance, what would be the result? Peter said that they could get their sins “blotted out.” That expression comes from a Greek word that means to “wipe out, erase.” So when Jehovah forgives, he wipes the slate clean. He forgives completely.—<a>Heb. 10:22;</a><a>&#160;1&#160;John 1:7</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 6/15 3:11, 12</a></desc></text>

Incredibly, he said: “Of what benefit to me is a birthright?” Yes, Esau chose a bowl of stew over his right as firstborn! To make the birthright transaction legal, Jacob insisted: “Swear to me first of all!” Without hesitation, Esau gave up his birthright.

Even when seniors want to remain by themselves and in control of their own situation as long as possible, there are definite benefits to discussing with their children what kind of care they would prefer if the need arises. Parents, during such a discussion, inform your family about your wishes, financial abilities, and preferred options.

As Bible students, we know that Jehovah cannot possibly be the cause of all these problems. He created this planet to be a delightful paradise. (<a>Gen. 2:8,</a><a>&#160;15</a>) Jehovah is a God of love. (<a>1&#160;John 4:8</a>) Our study of the Scriptures has helped us to identify the real cause of many of the world’s difficulties. It is none other than Satan the Devil, “the ruler of the world.” (<a>John 14:30;</a><a>&#160;2&#160;Cor. 4:4</a>) However, we cannot blame Satan for all our woes. Why not? Because some of our problems are the result of our own mistakes. (<a>Deut. 32:4-6</a>) Even though we might admit that fact, our imperfect nature can distort our thinking and cause us to go down a path that eventually leads to disaster. (<a>Prov. 14:12</a>) In what way? Instead of blaming ourselves or Satan for a problem, we could start to blame Jehovah. We might even become “enraged against Jehovah himself.”—<a>Prov. 19:3</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 8/15 2:2, 3</a></desc></text>

By the fourth century, weedlike Christians had greatly outnumbered anointed Christians. Jesus said: “Let both grow together until the harvest.” (<a>Matt. 13:30</a>) This command reveals that from the first century until today, there have always been some anointed wheatlike Christians on earth. That conclusion is confirmed by what Jesus later told his disciples: “I am with you <i>all</i> the days until the conclusion of the system of things.” (<a>Matt. 28:20</a>) So anointed Christians would be protected by Jesus all the days leading up to the time of the end. However, since they were overgrown by weedlike Christians, we do not know for certain who belonged to the wheat class during that long period of time. However, some decades before the start of the harvest season, the wheat class became discernible. <a><i>w13</i> 7/15 2:3, 4</a></desc></text>

A generous person gives freely of his time, energy, and resources to benefit others—and he does so gladly. Really, generosity is measured, not by the size of the gift, but by the motive of the giver. (<a>2&#160;Cor. 9:7</a>) No one is more generous than our “happy God,” Jehovah. (<a>1&#160;Tim. 1:11</a>) How does Jehovah demonstrate generosity? He provides for the needs of all humans, including those not yet worshipping him. Indeed, “Jehovah is good to <i>all.”</i> (<a>Ps. 145:9</a>) He “makes his sun rise upon wicked people and good and makes it rain upon righteous people and unrighteous.” (<a>Matt. 5:45</a>) That is why the apostle Paul, when speaking to unbelievers, could say that Jehovah “did good, giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts to the full with food and good cheer.” (<a>Acts 14:17</a>) Clearly, Jehovah is generous toward all humans.—<a>Luke 6:35</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 6/15 2:4, 5</a></desc></text>

For instance, some have received the Nobel Prize for acting zealously to establish peace between hostile or alienated parties. But how much greater an honor it is to be sent by God as an ambassador or envoy to help people establish peaceful relations with their Creator! As Jehovah’s Witnesses, we bear that singular honor. We are being used by Jehovah to draw people to him. This is how millions in over 235 lands have been helped to enjoy good relations with God and thus have the hope of gaining everlasting life. (<a>Titus 2:11</a>) With heartfelt zeal, we invite “anyone that wishes [to] take life’s water free.” (<a>Rev. 22:17</a>) Because we cherish this precious assignment and carry it out diligently, we may rightly be called a people “zealous for fine works.”—<a>Titus 2:14</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 5/15 2:1, 2</a></desc></text>

Why? Our confidence in God’s Word and our ability to use it in the ministry will help us to assist others to get to know Jehovah and to attain to salvation. The apostle Paul emphasized the importance of God’s Word when he wrote to Timothy: “Continue in the things that you learned and were persuaded to believe.” “The things” that Paul mentioned are Bible truths that moved Timothy to put faith in the good news.

In their minds, being a slave conjures up thoughts of being cruelly dominated, oppressed, and unjustly treated. But God’s inspired Word speaks of slavery that involves willing service to a loving Master. In fact, when the apostle Paul admonished first-century Christians to “slave for Jehovah,” he was encouraging sacred service prompted by love of God. When we presented ourselves for Christian baptism, we had already decided to serve Jehovah, to be his slave. Our dedication sprang from our desire to obey Jehovah and to do his will. Nobody forced us to do this. Indeed, even young ones who get baptized do so only after they make their own personal dedication to Jehovah, not simply to please their parents. The basis for Christian dedication is love of our heavenly Master, Jehovah.—<a>1&#160;John 5:3</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 10/15 2:1,</a><a>&#160;3</a></desc></text>

Being “humble in mind” plays a key role in keeping that stream flowing. (<a>1&#160;Pet. 3:8</a>) “Humility is the quickest route to resolve a difference because it moves you to say, ‘I’m sorry,’” noted a brother who has been married for 11 years. Pride, however, is anything but conciliatory. It stifles communication because it takes away both the desire and the courage to apologize. Instead of humbly saying, “I’m sorry; please forgive me,” the proud person makes excuses. Rather than courageously acknowledging a weakness, he points to faults in the other person. When hurt, instead of pursuing peace, he takes offense, perhaps retaliating with harsh words or icy silence.

We see his loving concern when he healed the sick and infirm and when he resurrected the dead. However, Jesus’ primary mission was not that of healing people physically. His preaching and teaching had a far more enduring impact on people’s lives. How so? We know that those whom Jesus healed and resurrected in the first century, for example, eventually grew old and died, whereas those who responded favorably to the message he preached put themselves in line for everlasting life. (<a>John 11:25,&#160;26</a>) The preaching work that Jesus started in the first century is being done on an even grander scale today.

(<a>Rom. 3:23</a>) Nevertheless, because of Jehovah’s love, he took the initiative to open the way for us to have a close relationship with him. “By this the love of God was revealed in our case,” wrote the apostle John, “that God sent his only-begotten Son into the world so that we might gain life through him.

He does not rehash our sins in order to accuse us or punish us again and again. Rather, Jehovah forgives those sins and puts them behind him—permanently.

In contrast, Jacob deeply appreciated his inheritance. For instance, Jacob acted in harmony with parental instruction in choosing a wife. (<a>Gen. 27:46–28:3</a>) Because Jacob made this choice that required patience and sacrifice, he became a forefather of the Messiah. How did God view Esau and Jacob?

Instead, they follow the Scriptures and the leadings of God’s holy spirit as they make arrangements that are needed to help the preaching work go forward.

At a certain point, they may also have to start taking the lead in what was previously the parent’s realm of personal activities. In order to optimize the care that parents receive, children may have to become their advocates, secretaries, chauffeurs, and so on. Later, changes may need to be made in their care or living arrangements. The smaller the changes, the easier the adjustment will likely be. However, if elderly ones are not going to be safe on their own, more permanent assistance would be in order.

Instead of losing patience with them, Jesus continued to teach his disciples and to give them loving counsel about manifesting humility. (<a>Luke 9:46-48</a>) By washing their feet, Jesus provided an object lesson in humility, a quality that Christian overseers need to display.—<a>John 13:12-15;</a><a>&#160;1&#160;Pet. 2:21</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 11/15 5:8</a></desc></text>

However, working in the ministry with fellow Christians is truly upbuilding.

Perhaps Mom or Dad has fallen and broken a hip, has become disoriented and wandered off, or has been diagnosed with a serious medical condition. Then there is the other side of the coin. The elderly may find it hard to accept that physical changes or other circumstances now limit their independence. (<a>Job 14:1</a>) What can be done? How can they be looked after? One article on care for the elderly states: “While it is difficult to discuss the issues of aging, the family who has discussed the options and agreed on plans will be better able to handle whatever happens.” The value of such a discussion is best appreciated when we acknowledge that trials that come with age cannot be avoided.

A poet once said: “Your arm’s too short to box with God.” We may never go so far as to vocalize a complaint against Jehovah. But today’s text says that a man’s foolishness “distorts his way, and so his heart becomes enraged against Jehovah himself.” Yes, a person can become enraged against God in <i>his</i> <i>heart.</i> This attitude could manifest itself in subtle ways.

The Bible Students taught the true meaning of Christ’s ransom sacrifice, exposed the hellfire lie, and proclaimed the coming end of the Gentile Times.

As God’s fellow workers, then, are we personally determined to have the fullest share in proclaiming the good news that our circumstances will permit?

Also, Jesus made this promise to his anointed brothers: “To the one who conquers and observes my deeds down to the end, I will give authority over the nations, and he will shepherd the people with an iron rod so that they will be broken to pieces like clay vessels, just as I have received from my Father.” (<a>Rev. 2:26,&#160;27</a>) So Christ’s heavenly armies will also include his anointed brothers, who by then will have received their heavenly reward.

The subsequent famines, earthquakes, and pestilences as well as the fulfillment of other Bible prophecies proved conclusively that Jesus Christ had begun to rule in heaven as King of God’s Kingdom in 1914. The first mission of God’s newly installed King was to wage war against his Father’s chief Adversary, Satan. Jesus and his angels cast the Devil and his demons out of heaven.

The corruption became so great that even family relationships broke down. Aware that he could do nothing to change the situation himself, Micah poured out his heart to Jehovah. Then he waited patiently for God to act. Micah was confident that Jehovah would intervene in His own time. Like Micah, we have to live among selfish people.

A Hebrew slave was to be granted his freedom in the seventh year of his servitude. (<a>Ex. 21:2</a>) However, for a slave who really loved his master and who wished to remain in his service, Jehovah made a remarkable provision. The master was to bring his slave up against the door or the doorpost and pierce his ear through with an awl. (<a>Ex. 21:5,&#160;6</a>) It is of significance that this procedure involved the ear. In the Hebrew language, the basic idea of obedience is expressed by a word that relates to hearing and listening. The willing slave desired to continue giving obedient service to his master.

Of course, marriage mates may need to give each other a little time to cool down. It is also fitting to pray for Jehovah’s help to get in the right frame of mind. This includes having a humble spirit, which will help you to focus on the problem, not on yourself, lest you aggravate the situation. (<a>Col. 3:12,&#160;13</a>) Humility and modesty help a married person focus on the strengths of his or her mate. <a><i>w13</i> 5/15 3:15, 16</a></desc></text>

(<a>Mark 7:5,</a><a>&#160;10-13</a>) Jesus himself set a good example. For instance, when he was at the point of death on the stake, Jesus entrusted the care of his mother, who was apparently then a widow, to his beloved disciple John. (<a>John 19:26,&#160;27</a>) The apostle Paul was inspired to write that believers should provide for their own households. (<a>1&#160;Tim. 5:4,</a><a>&#160;8,</a><a>&#160;16</a>) Consider the context of what Paul wrote to Timothy. Paul discussed who might and who might not qualify to receive financial support from the congregation. He made it plain that believing children, grandchildren, and other relatives of elderly widows were to be the primary providers. Likewise today, one of the ways in which Christians practice “godly devotion” is by providing materially for relatives in need. <a><i>w14</i> 3/15 3:6, 7</a></desc></text>

Today, anointed servants of Jehovah perform the same ministry. What they accomplish as ambassadors for God and Christ makes it possible for rightly disposed people to be drawn by Jehovah and become believers. (<a>2&#160;Cor. 5:18-20;</a><a>&#160;John 6:44;</a><a>&#160;Acts 13:48</a>) Out of appreciation for Jehovah as the Grand Provider, all Christians who have an earthly hope share with the anointed in the Kingdom-preaching work. <a><i>w14</i> 2/15 3:10-12</a></desc></text>

Do not give up trying to strengthen your faith. After the apostle Paul described his efforts to pursue a way of life that God could bless, he wrote: “If you are mentally inclined otherwise in any respect, God will reveal the above attitude to you. At any rate, to the extent we have made progress, let us go on walking orderly in this same course.” (<a>Phil. 3:15,&#160;16</a>) Continue to consider God’s love and his wise advice.

Jehovah is a real, living God who is interested in his people and who acts in their behalf. He proved this at the time he protected the Israelite firstborn “when he plagued the Egyptians.” (<a>Ex. 12:27</a>) Christian parents do not each year recount to their sons and daughters the meaning of that Passover. Do you, however, teach your children this same lesson—that God protects his people? Do you convey to them your deep conviction that Jehovah is still a real Protector of his people?

When “the Assyrian” attacks, the elders must be absolutely convinced that Jehovah will deliver us. At that time, the life-saving direction that we receive from Jehovah’s organization may not appear practical from a human standpoint.

Yet, this may have little effect on their thinking and way of life. What is missing? For God’s Word to influence and transform a person, he must allow it to be “sounded down” into the heart. (<a>Gal. 6:6</a>, ftn.) Hence, we need to spend time thinking about what we are learning. It would be good to ask ourselves: ‘Am I convinced that this is more than just some religious teaching? Have I not seen that it is the truth? Moreover, do I see ways to apply in my own life what I am learning and not view it only as something I might teach to others? Do I feel that Jehovah is talking to me personally?’ Thinking and meditating on such questions can help us to deepen the feelings we have for Jehovah in our hearts. Our love for him will grow.

In the past, Jehovah dealt patiently with those of his servants who at times were discouraged. For instance, God was very gracious with Elijah, considering his feelings. Jehovah provided what the prophet needed to carry on in his service. (<a>1&#160;Ki. 19:1-18</a>) Because David was genuinely repentant, Jehovah kindly forgave him. (<a>Ps. 51:7,</a><a>&#160;17</a>) God also helped the writer of <a>Psalm 73</a>, who almost gave up serving Him. (<a>Ps. 73:13,</a><a>&#160;16,&#160;17</a>) Jehovah is gracious and kind to us, especially when we are downhearted and discouraged. (<a>Ex. 34:6</a>) His mercies are “new each morning,” and they “will certainly not come to an end.” (<a>Lam. 3:22,&#160;23</a>) Jehovah expects us to follow his example and treat the depressed ones with tenderness. <a><i>w13</i> 8/15 3:15</a></desc></text>

When giving the sign of his presence, Jesus said that he would use “the faithful and discreet slave” to give “food at the proper time” to his domestics. (<a>Matt. 24:45-47</a>) That faithful slave is the channel through which Jesus is feeding his true followers in this time of the end. It is vital that we recognize the faithful slave.

(<a>Job 10:1;</a><a>&#160;19:2</a>) In the end, Jehovah reproved those false accusers. God directed them to go to Job and present an offering for their sins. (<a>Job 42:7-9</a>) But Jehovah also required that <i>Job</i> do something. What was it? Jehovah directed Job to pray in behalf of his former accusers. Job did as Jehovah asked, and Jehovah blessed him for his forgiving spirit. (<a>Job 42:10,</a><a>&#160;12,</a><a>&#160;16,&#160;17</a>) The lesson for us?

On hearing Peter’s application of these words, many listeners “were stabbed to the heart.” They repented over their past sins. About three thousand of them sought God’s forgiveness and became Christians. (<a>Acts 2:37-41</a>) The apostle Paul spoke to those worshipping in a synagogue in Thessalonica.

Yet, primary caregivers ought to balance their parents’ needs with the needs of their own families. There is a limit to each individual’s time and energy. And the caregiver’s situation might change, making it necessary to review the current arrangements. Is one family member perhaps taking on too many responsibilities? Could the other children do more, such as by taking turns providing care? When an elderly parent is in constant need, there is a risk of caregiver burnout. Unremitting demands can become overwhelming. Caregivers who find themselves in this situation need to be realistic, possibly asking for help.

For instance, we observe the way Jehovah thwarts opposers. Look back over the past few years. Have we not seen clearly the way God is guiding us?

Ungodly society will continue to advance from bad to worse until Jehovah steps in to end it. Historians have documented that here or there some society or nation experienced a steep moral decline and then collapsed. Never before in history, though, has the overall morality of the entire world deteriorated to the extent that it has now.

(<a>Eph. 5:15,&#160;16</a>) He might ask: ‘How much time am I actually expending on recreation or leisure pursuits? Do I need to exercise greater self-discipline? Could I adjust my secular work schedule?’ Any Christian will admit that it is easy to add things to one’s schedule; thus, those in the full-time service may need to assess matters regularly and make adjustments if needed.

The apostle Paul had that humble attitude, for he told the older men of the congregation in Ephesus: “You well know how from the first day that I stepped into the district of Asia I was with you the whole time, slaving for the Lord with the greatest lowliness of mind.” The apostle desired that those elders help others in an earnest, humble manner. He said: “I have exhibited to you in all things that by thus laboring you must assist those who are weak.” (<a>Acts 20:18, 19,</a><a>&#160;35</a>) Paul told the Corinthians that he was not the master over their faith.

But thanks to God that you were the slaves of sin but you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching to which you were handed over.

Four of the seven directors of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society rebelled against the decision to have Brother Rutherford take the lead. They tried to cause division among the brothers, but in August&#160;1917, they left Bethel—a cleansing indeed! Also, some Bible Students gave in to the fear of man. Still, as a whole they willingly responded to Jesus’ cleansing work and made the needed changes. Hence, Jesus judged them to be true Christian wheat, but he rejected all imitation Christians, including all of those found within the churches of Christendom.—<a>Mal. 3:5</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 7/15 2:8</a></desc></text>

Can you ‘buy out’ time from other things so as to spend more of it with your family? Some families agree to limit television viewing or computer use. Others strive to have at least one meal together each day. And what a fine opportunity the arrangement of family worship offers for parents and children to draw close to one another and discuss spiritual matters calmly! Setting aside an hour or so a week for this purpose is a good start, but more is needed to open the door to deep conversation. For that, regular and frequent communication is a must. Before your young one heads out for school, say something encouraging, discuss the daily text, or offer a prayer with your child.

Some of God’s servants, though, have an even greater challenge. Jesus said that his followers would face family opposition, and he used words similar to those recorded at <a>Micah 7:6</a> to describe the impact that his message would have. “I came to cause division,” said Jesus, “with a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a young wife against her mother-in-law.

This is especially true in Christian households. Although parents and children yearn to be close to one another, communication is sometimes difficult. Many families find that it is challenging to have enough time for meaningful communication. That was not always the case. In ancient Israel, children spent the day either with their mother at home or with their father in the fields or at his workplace. There was plenty of time for children and parents to be together and converse. Consequently, parents were in a position to get to know the needs, desires, and personality of their children. Likewise, there was time and sufficient opportunity for children to get to know their parents well. How different life is today! <a><i>w13</i> 5/15 4:2-4</a></desc></text>

Exactly how children provide care varies. No two situations are alike. The needs, temperament, and health of those involved differ. Some older ones have many children; others just one child. Some can count on support from the State; others cannot. Personal preferences of those needing care also differ. Thus, it would not be wise or loving to criticize the way in which someone is trying to care for aged relatives.

A loving human shepherd takes full responsibility for the survival and welfare of the flock of sheep under his care. He leads them to pasture and to water sources (<a>Ps. 23:1,&#160;2</a>); watches over them by day and by night (<a>Luke 2:8</a>); protects them from predators (<a>1&#160;Sam. 17:34,&#160;35</a>); carries the newborn (<a>Isa. 40:11</a>); searches for strays, and cares well for sheep that are injured.

By comparison, though, how do we individually rate our personal communication with our best Friend, Jehovah? How often do we take the initiative to speak to him? Some servants of God do not find it easy to open their hearts and express their deep emotions. Yet, that is what Jehovah wants us to do when we pray. (<a>Ps. 119:145;</a><a>&#160;Lam. 3:41</a>) Even if we find such heartfelt expressions difficult to put into words, we are not without help. Paul wrote to Christians in Rome: “The spirit itself pleads for us with unuttered groanings. But the one who searches the hearts knows what the meaning of the spirit is, because it is pleading in harmony with God for the holy ones.” (<a>Rom. 8:26,&#160;27</a>) Our meditating on the words recorded in such Bible books as Job, Psalms, and Proverbs will help us to express our inmost feelings to Jehovah. <a><i>w14</i> 2/15 4:18, 19</a></desc></text>

The first group discerned the sign of Christ’s presence in 1914. They were not merely alive in 1914, but they were spirit-anointed as sons of God in or before that year. (<a>Rom. 8:14-17</a>) The second group included in “this generation” are anointed contemporaries of the first group. They were not simply alive during the lifetime of those in the first group, but they were anointed with holy spirit during the time that those of the first group were still on earth. Today, Jesus’ words give us confidence that at least some of “this generation will by no means pass away” before seeing the start of the great tribulation. This should add to our conviction that little time remains before the King of God’s Kingdom acts to destroy the wicked and usher in a righteous new world.—<a>2&#160;Pet. 3:13</a>. <a><i>w14</i> 1/15 5:15, 16</a></desc></text>

(<a>Rom. 14:1-4</a>) The only authority that Christian overseers have comes from the Scriptures. Therefore, it is vital that they use the Bible skillfully and adhere to what it says.

Pioneers realize that their privilege of service is not the result of any special merit on their part. Rather, any gift or service privilege that we might have is because of God’s undeserved kindness. Thus, in order to continue as a pioneer, each one must rely on Jehovah. (<a>Phil. 4:13</a>) Challenges and difficulties will arise.

Those taking the lead among the Bible Students began to stress the importance of sharing personally in the Kingdom preaching work. For instance, <i>To</i> <i>Whom</i> <i>the</i> <i>Work</i> <i>Is</i> <i>Entrusted,</i> a pamphlet published in 1919, urged <i>all</i> anointed Christians to preach from house to house.

Consequently, we have an ongoing struggle against our fleshly tendencies. We have a second battle to wage, our fight against this world under demon influence. Satan, the ruler of the world, aims his missiles at us in an attempt to break our loyalty to Jehovah and Jesus. He seeks to enslave us by tempting us to give in to his corrupting influence.

If we are beset by tragedy or personal problems, might we likewise say in our heart, ‘Where was Jehovah when I needed him?’ Because of not having all the facts, the Israelites in Ezekiel’s day felt that Jehovah’s way was “not adjusted right.” (<a>Ezek. 18:29</a>) It was as if they had set themselves up as judges of God, relying on their own limited understanding of events. If we at times do not fully understand a Bible account or the way events develop in our own life, could we perhaps feel in our heart that the way of Jehovah is unfair, “not adjusted right”?—<a>Job 35:2</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 8/15 2:8, 9</a></desc></text>

He lovingly understood that not everyone could give the same amount, and he required from each one only according to the individual’s ability. Jehovah’s law stipulated that the blood of the animal be shed, which was to be “a shadow of the good things to come” through his Son, Jesus. (<a>Heb. 10:1-4</a>) However, Jehovah was not rigid in the application of that law. For example, God would accept an offering of turtledoves if the person could not afford an offering from the flock or the herd.

Even young children can learn to be generous toward Jehovah. “When our family makes a donation at the Kingdom Hall, we let our children put the money in the contribution box,” says their father, Jason. “They enjoy it because, as they put it, they’re ‘giving something to Jehovah.’” Children who experience the joy of giving to Jehovah while they are young are likely to continue being generous toward him in adulthood.—<a>Prov. 22:6</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 6/15 2:9-11</a></desc></text>

(<a>Luke 4:16;</a><a>&#160;Acts 15:21</a>) This emphasis on meeting together continued with the formation of the Christian congregation, and it is still a major part of our worship. One important way in which we encourage one another is by having a share in our meetings. We can make a public expression of our faith by answering a printed question, by giving an application of a scripture, by relating a brief experience that illustrates the wisdom of following Bible principles, or in other ways.

Yet, Jehovah’s view of us is more important than ours, and his thinking is much higher than ours.

When you use God’s Word to test yourself to see “whether you are in the faith,” you will be seeing yourself more as God sees you.

The only way to cross the water was to jump from one large stone to another.

(<a>Ps. 51:5;</a><a>&#160;Rom. 3:23</a>) In addition, many of us were once among those whose minds were “blinded” by Satan; we were once ignorant of Jehovah and his righteous standards. (<a>2&#160;Cor. 4:4;</a><a>&#160;Titus 3:3</a>) Hence, were we to base our decisions solely on what we feel is good and reasonable, we might be deceiving ourselves, no matter how much we ponder the decision before us. (<a>Prov. 14:12</a>) Though we are far from being sound in body and mind, Jehovah, our heavenly Father, is perfect in every respect. (<a>Deut. 32:4</a>) Happily, he has made it possible for us to make our mind over and to cultivate soundness of mind. (<a>2&#160;Tim. 1:7</a>) As Christians, we want to think and reason sensibly and to act accordingly. We must rein in, or control, our thinking and feelings and imitate the way Jehovah thinks, feels, and acts. <a><i>w13</i> 9/15 4:4-6</a></desc></text>

The apostles could perform miracles and even transmit miraculous gifts as proof of divine backing. (<a>Acts 5:12</a>) So why would anyone need to ask who really was appointed by Christ to take the lead? In 1914, however, the situation was much different. The harvest season began in that year. The time had finally arrived to separate the weeds from the wheat. (<a>Matt. 13:36-43</a>) As the harvest season began, a vital question thus arose: With many imitation Christians claiming to be Jesus’ true followers, how could the wheat—anointed Christians—be identified? The illustration of the faithful slave provided an answer. Christ’s anointed followers would be the ones who were well-fed spiritually. <a><i>w13</i> 7/15 4:7</a></desc></text>

By what means does Satan make our heart his target? Satan’s weapons include “the things in the world.” (<a>1&#160;John 2:15,&#160;16</a>) Over thousands of years, the Devil has carefully crafted the environment surrounding us. Since we live in this world, we need to guard against his subtle tactics. (<a>John 17:15</a>) Satan uses methods designed to corrupt the desires of the heart. The apostle John identifies three enticements that Satan employs: (1)&#160;“the desire of the flesh,” (2)&#160;“the desire of the eyes,” and (3)&#160;“the showy display of one’s means of life.” Satan used them to tempt Jesus in the wilderness. Having had years of practice using such traps, Satan today uses them effectively, adapting his approach to each person’s inclinations. <a><i>w13</i> 8/15 4:4-6</a></desc></text>

Imagine the immense stress that he was feeling at the last evening meal he had with his apostles. Jesus knew that within hours he would die a slow and painful death. The sanctification of his Father’s name and the salvation of the human family depended on his faithfulness. Yet, at that very meal, there “arose a heated dispute among [the apostles] over which one of them seemed to be greatest.” Jesus did not scream at them or express bitterness toward them. Instead, he calmly reasoned with them. Jesus reminded them that they had stuck with him during trying times. Although Satan was demanding to sift them as wheat, Jesus expressed confidence that they would prove faithful. He even concluded a covenant with them.—<a>Luke 22:24-32</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 5/15 4:15, 16</a></desc></text>

(<a>Jer. 18:1-6</a>) With ancient Israel, Jehovah demonstrated his ability to do what the potter does to clay. But there is a marked difference. A potter can make any sort of vessel he is capable of making from a lump of clay. Does Jehovah arbitrarily mold people or nations, making some good and others bad? The Bible’s answer is no. Jehovah has given mankind a very precious gift—the gift of free will. He does not exercise his sovereign authority in a way that nullifies his gift. Humans must choose to be molded by the Creator, Jehovah.—<a>Jer. 18:7-10</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 6/15 4:3, 4</a></desc></text>

(<a>Acts 15:36-39</a>) What helped him to succeed? Paul struck at his imperfect human nature with well-directed spiritual blows. (<a>1&#160;Cor. 9:26,&#160;27</a>) Very likely, he looked for points of counsel in the Scriptures, supplicated Jehovah for help to apply them, and worked hard to improve.

What was the basis for that faithful man’s enduring friendship with his Creator? It was Abraham’s faith.

Think back to the time when you discovered that God is a real Person, someone with whom you could develop a close relationship. When we learned about his provision of Jesus’ ransom sacrifice and exercised faith in that provision, we began to build a friendship with God.

Could you invite younger servants of God to your home for some upbuilding association? Could you ask them to accompany you in the Christian ministry and show them the joy you experience in serving Jehovah? Elihu of ancient times said: “Let age speak, and let a multitude of years declare wisdom.” (<a>Job 32:7</a>) The apostle Paul urged experienced Christian women to encourage others by word and example.

How may an elder be an example to the flock? Consider two of the qualifications that must be met by a man who is “reaching out for an office of overseer.” He needs to be “sound in mind” and must be “presiding over his own household in a fine manner.” If an elder has a family, he must preside over it in an exemplary way, for “if indeed any man does not know how to preside over his own household, how will he take care of God’s congregation?” (<a>1&#160;Tim. 3:1, 2,</a><a>&#160;4,&#160;5</a>) To qualify for the office of overseer, a man must be sound in mind in that he clearly understands divine principles and knows how to apply them in his own life.

Still, there are features of the Passover observance that was instituted back in Egypt that have meaning for us. The lamb’s blood sprinkled on the doorposts and lintel was a means to preserve life. Today, we do not offer animal sacrifices to God. But there is a better sacrifice that can preserve life permanently. The apostle Paul wrote about “the congregation of the firstborn who have been enrolled in the heavens.” The means of preserving the lives of those anointed Christians is “the blood of sprinkling,” Jesus’ blood. (<a>Heb. 12:23,&#160;24</a>) Christians who hope to live forever on earth depend on that same blood for preservation.

Natural Israel was hopelessly divided religiously and socially, bringing great reproach on God’s holy name.

So, what does Jesus do? He offers the most beautiful prayer that any human will ever be privileged to read.

The human undershepherds to whom they entrust the care of the congregations are not. This reality may make it challenging for some to follow the elders’ lead. Such individuals may reason: ‘They are imperfect humans just like us. Why should we listen to their counsel?’ However, we need to have a proper view of their shortcomings and weaknesses. The Scriptures candidly acknowledge the failings of those whom Jehovah used to lead his people in the past. (<a>2&#160;Sam. 12:7-9;</a><a>&#160;Matt. 16:18, 19;</a><a>&#160;John 13:38;</a><a>&#160;18:27;</a><a>&#160;Gal. 2:11-14</a>) In having Bible writers record the shortcomings of men whom he had commissioned, God showed that he can use imperfect men to lead his people.

Go, then, and learn what this means, ‘I want mercy, and not sacrifice.’” (<a>Matt. 9:11-13</a>) He patiently and kindly explained God’s words to all. Hence, humble ones came to know Jehovah as “a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness and truth.” (<a>Ex. 34:6</a>) In response to the efforts of God’s Son to ‘set things straight,’ many came to have faith in the good news. Jesus’ example teaches us how we should help others. Someone who is upset might say in an abrupt tone, ‘I want to set something straight with you.’ But “all Scripture” does not authorize us to tell others off.

One way he trains them is by means of the Theocratic Ministry School, which is conducted in each of the more than 111,000 congregations throughout the earth.

If a person was in an unclean state, he would have to make a sin offering or a guilt offering to restore his standing with Jehovah before making a voluntary offering. (<a>Lev. 5:5, 6,</a><a>&#160;15</a>) This was a serious matter. Jehovah stipulated that if someone in an unclean state partook of a communion sacrifice, which included voluntary offerings, he would be cut off from God’s people.

God’s enemy wants all who dedicate their lives to Jehovah to fail in their devotion and loyalty. Satan promotes the idea that a career in his world will satisfy a person, but Christians should take into account the importance of satisfying their spiritual need. “Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need,” taught Jesus.

Our imperfect mind and heart can be like a watch that is going either too fast or too slow. Being guided by it could bring us serious trouble. We need to calibrate our mind and heart by God’s reliable standards. (<a>Isa. 55:8,&#160;9</a>) With good reason, the Bible admonishes us: “Trust in Jehovah with all your heart and do not lean upon your own understanding. In all your ways take notice of him, and he himself will make your paths straight.” (<a>Prov. 3:5,&#160;6</a>) Note the expression “do not lean upon your own understanding.” It is followed by “take notice of [Jehovah].” He is the One with a truly sound mind.

We can avoid the imperfect tendency to become enraged against God if we maintain a close relationship with him. (<a>Prov. 3:5,&#160;6</a>) We need to trust in Jehovah. We also need to avoid becoming wise in our own eyes or becoming self-centered. (<a>Prov. 3:7;</a><a>&#160;Eccl. 7:16</a>) We will then be less likely to blame Jehovah when bad things happen. If we meditate on Jehovah’s activities, remembering all the good things he has done for us, we will strengthen our relationship with him. <a><i>w13</i> 8/15 2:12-14</a></desc></text>

Consider the example of how Jehovah dealt with the righteous man Lot.

For some reason, though, Lot pleaded for permission to flee to another location. Just think—Lot actually asked Jehovah to change His instructions! (<a>Gen. 19:17-20</a>) It might be easy for someone to judge Lot as being weak or disobedient. After all, Jehovah surely could have kept Lot alive anywhere, so Lot’s fears really had no basis. Nevertheless, they were still his fears—Lot felt what he felt, and Jehovah yielded accordingly. He allowed Lot to flee to a city that He had intended to destroy.

Presently, those represented by the weeds are boasting, not weeping. But that is about to change.

Parents, do you really listen to your children? This may be difficult when you are tired or when the conversation seems somewhat trivial. But what appears to be trivial to you may be very important to your child. To be “swift about hearing” means being attentive not only to what your child says but also to how he or she says it. Tone of voice and body language give clues about how a young one feels. Asking questions is also important. “A person’s thoughts are like water in a deep well,” says the Bible, “but someone with insight can draw them out.” (<a>Prov. 20:5</a>, <i>Today’s</i> <i>English</i> <i>Version</i>) Insight and discernment are especially needed when you are drawing your children out on sensitive topics. <a><i>w13</i> 5/15 4:7, 8</a></desc></text>

(<a>1&#160;Cor. 9:24-27</a>) What should we do, however, if we commit a serious sin? Get help as soon as possible. Keeping the matter hidden will only make matters worse. Remember, David said that when he kept silent about his sins, ‘his bones wore out through his groaning all day long.’ (<a>Ps. 32:3</a>) Yes, hiding secret sins will just cause us to tire out emotionally and spiritually, but “he that is confessing and leaving them will be shown mercy.”—<a>Prov. 28:13</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 4/15 4:15, 16</a></desc></text>

Of course, their generosity does not relieve children who are in the full-time service far from home of the responsibility to do what they can for their parents. All involved in the caregiving process can endeavor to make the experience as pleasant as possible. If you have a role in this, do your utmost to maintain a positive spirit. In some cases, aging causes despondency, even depression. You may thus need to put forth special effort to honor and encourage older brothers and sisters by keeping conversations with them upbuilding.

Through Jehovah’s organization and its publications, we receive loving reminders for our protection. Consider how this has proved to be of benefit in recent times. As this world sinks further into the quagmire of debauchery and pornography, Jehovah has provided urgent reminders and practical help to alert us to moral dangers.

Yet, what Anna could do, she enjoyed doing. “She was never missing from the temple, rendering sacred service night and day.” As the priest offered incense in the temple each morning and evening, Anna would be with the assembled crowd in the courtyard offering silent prayer for perhaps half an hour.

The Jews asked Pilate that the bones of the impaled men be broken. This would hasten their death so that they would not be left on the stakes into Nisan 15, a double Sabbath. Soldiers broke the legs of the two impaled criminals, “but on coming to Jesus, as they saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.” (<a>John 19:31-34</a>) That matched what was done with the Passover lamb, so this lamb was in that sense “a shadow” of what was to come on Nisan 14, 33&#160;C.E.

In this regard, Jesus set the example for overseers. Preaching the good news of the Kingdom was an important part of Jesus’ earthly activity. He showed his disciples how this work was to be done. (<a>Mark 1:38</a>) In our day, how encouraging it is for publishers to preach side by side with elders, to witness the elders’ zeal for this lifesaving work, and to learn from their teaching methods!

His main concern is the glorification of his heavenly Father, and this harmonizes with the first request in Jesus’ model prayer: “Father, let your name be sanctified.” (<a>Luke 11:2</a>) Jesus’ next concern is for the needs of his disciples, that “he may give them everlasting life.” After that, Jesus makes a personal request, saying the words of today’s text.

David’s appreciation for God’s magnificence and splendor inspired him to exalt Jehovah “all day long.” (<a>Ps. 35:28</a>) Like David, we need to communicate with Jehovah regularly in order to build trust in him.

(<a>Gen. 2:9;</a><a>&#160;3:1-5</a>) The Devil thus insinuated that Eve did not need to be obedient to God in order to live. What a blatant lie that was! Once the idea was planted in Eve’s mind, she had two options: She could reject the idea, or she could keep dwelling on it, allowing her desire for the fruit to grow. Despite the fact that all the other trees of the garden were at her disposal, she chose to dwell on what Satan had said concerning the tree in the middle of the garden, and she “began taking of its fruit and eating it.” Satan thus created within her a desire for something that was forbidden by her Creator. <a><i>w13</i> 8/15 4:7</a></desc></text>

Jehovah exercises his potterlike authority over humans by adjusting his dealings with them depending on their response to his molding. Those who respond properly are fashioned in a beneficial way.

As for me and my household, we shall serve Jehovah.” (<a>Josh. 24:15</a>) Joshua and those who stuck with him were blessed with settling in the Promised Land, “a land flowing with milk and honey.” (<a>Josh. 5:6</a>) As the Greater Joshua, Jesus is now poised to bring this corrupt system to its end and lead his followers to the promised new world of righteousness. <a><i>w13</i> 9/15 4:15,</a><a>&#160;18</a></desc></text>

(<a>Luke 15:3-7</a>) Are you among those who are not now actively serving God? Perhaps someone in the congregation hurt you and as a result you stopped associating with Jehovah’s organization. Since some time may have passed, ask yourself: ‘Is my life now more meaningful, and am I happier? Was it Jehovah who offended me, or was it an imperfect human? Has Jehovah God ever done anything to harm me?’ Really, he has always done good toward us. Even if we are not living up to our dedication to him, he allows us to enjoy the good things he provides. (<a>Jas. 1:16,&#160;17</a>) Soon, Jehovah’s day will come. Now is the time to return to our heavenly Father’s loving arms and to the congregation—the only safe haven in these last days.—<a>Deut. 33:27;</a><a>&#160;Heb. 10:24,&#160;25</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 11/15 2:16, 17</a></desc></text>
