How long, then, will it be before you tell the people to turn back from pursuing their brothers?” <span id='dcv_2_27' class='dv dp'><a>27 </a></span>At that Jo′ab said: “As surely as the true God is living, if you had not spoken, then only by the morning would the people have stopped pursuing their brothers.” <span id='dcv_2_28' class='dv dp'><a>28 </a></span>Jo′ab now blew the horn, and his men stopped chasing after Israel, and the fighting ceased.</p></div><div id='p25' class='par'><p class='sb'><span id='dcv_2_29' class='dv dx dp'><a>29 </a></span>Ab′ner and his men then marched through the Ar′a·bah<a class='mr'></a> all that night and crossed the Jordan and marched through the entire ravine<a class='fn'></a> and finally came to Ma·ha·na′im.<a class='mr'></a> <span id='dcv_2_30' class='dv dp'><a>30 </a></span>After Jo′ab turned back from pursuing Ab′ner, he gathered all the people together.
