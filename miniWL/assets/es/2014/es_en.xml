<text date='01-01-2014'><date>Wednesday, January 1</date><script><i>The works of the flesh are manifest.—</i><a><i>Gal. 5:19</i></a><i>.</i></script><desc>Note how “the works of the flesh” breed disunity. (<a>Gal. 5:19-21</a>) <i>Fornication</i> separates the one practicing it from Jehovah and the congregation, and adultery can cruelly separate children from parents and innocent partners from marriage mates. <i>Uncleanness</i> affects a person’s unity with God and with those who love him. One who has attempted to glue two things together knows that both surfaces must be clean before a proper bond can be forged. Engaging in <i>brazen conduct</i> demonstrates total disregard for God’s righteous laws. Each of the other works of the flesh separates people from one another and from God. Such conduct is completely out of harmony with the personality of Jehovah. Thus, each of us needs to ask himself: ‘Just how earnest am I in trying “to observe the oneness of the spirit in the uniting bond of peace”? (<a>Eph. 4:3</a>) Do I air my grievances before a wide audience, hoping to get support from several friends?’ <a><i>w12</i> 7/15 4:8, 9</a></desc></text>

However, when they failed to reach a satisfying conclusion, many eventually gave up on their search for God. Indeed, Satan has “blinded the minds of the unbelievers.” (<a>2 Cor. 4:4</a>) Little wonder that the majority of mankind are left in ignorance and confusion as to the truth about the Father, the Creator of the universe! (<a>Isa. 45:18</a>) Yet, it is vital that people learn the truth about God. Why? Because only those who call “on the name of Jehovah” will be saved. (<a>Rom. 10:13</a>) To call on God’s name involves becoming acquainted with Jehovah as a Person. Jesus Christ disclosed to his disciples this vital knowledge. He revealed the Father to them. <a><i>w12</i> 4/15 1:2, 3</a></desc></text>

Some have chosen to separate because of a mate’s willful nonsupport. Others have done so because of extreme physical abuse or the absolute endangerment of a Christian’s spirituality. Whether to depart or not is a personal decision. However, the baptized mate ought to give this matter prayerful and honest consideration. A Christian who is married to an unbeliever should earnestly endeavor to keep the marriage bond intact. Yet, a Christian need not feel guilty if, despite the Christian’s sincere effort to preserve the union, an unbelieving mate refuses to remain with the believer. “If the unbelieving one proceeds to depart, let him depart,” wrote Paul. “A brother or a sister is not in servitude under such circumstances, but God has called you to peace.”—<a>1 Cor. 7:15</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 5/15 2:13-15,</a><a>&#160;17</a></desc></text>
<text date='04-01-2014'><date>Saturday, January 4</date><script><i>Men spoke from God as they were borne along by holy spirit.—</i><a><i>2</i> <i>Pet. 1:21</i></a><i>.</i></script><desc>Over a period of 1,610 years—spanning from 1513 B.C.E. to 98 C.E.—some 40 different men wrote the Bible. The Greek expression rendered “borne along” has the sense “to bear or carry from one place to another,” and it “can be variously rendered: be moved, be driven, let oneself be moved.” <a>Acts 27:15</a> uses it in describing a boat that was seized and moved, or driven along a certain course, by the wind. Bible prophets and writers were “borne along by holy spirit” in that God communicated with, motivated, and guided them by means of his active force. That being the case, they wrote, not their own ideas, but God’s thoughts. Sometimes the inspired prophets and writers did not even know the meaning of what they foretold or were writing. (<a>Dan. 12:8, 9</a>) Yes, “all Scripture is inspired of God” and is free of human opinions.—<a>2 Tim. 3:16</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 6/15 4:3</a></desc></text>

(<a>2 Tim. 3:1</a>) With the high cost of living and rising unemployment rates, you may find it difficult to make ends meet. You may also be anxious about the future and wonder, ‘Will I have enough income after I retire?’ Because of such anxiety, some have been led to pursue riches, thinking that money will guarantee security. The other factor is <i>“the deceptive power of riches.”</i> That element combined with anxiety can choke the word. The Bible acknowledges that “money is for a protection.” (<a>Eccl. 7:12</a>) However, the pursuit of riches is not wise. Many have found that the more they struggle to acquire riches, the more materialism entraps them. Some have even become slaves to riches.—<a>Matt. 6:24</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 8/15 4:3-5</a></desc></text>

One brother later recalled, “A few of us seriously thought we were going to heaven during the first week of that October [1914].” Just think how discouraging it could have been to expect the end and for it not to occur! Moreover, the brothers faced opposition related to World War I. A period of relative inactivity, like sleep, set in. But in 1919, there was a call to wake up! Jesus had come to God’s spiritual temple, and a time for inspection arrived. Some, however, failed that inspection and consequently lost their privilege to continue in the King’s “business.” The majority of anointed ones, though, showed unshakable loyalty and a strong desire to serve their Master even during the difficult war years. <a><i>w12</i> 9/15 4:11, 12</a></desc></text>
<text date='07-01-2014'><date>Tuesday, January 7</date><script><i>He did on a grand scale what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah.—</i><a><i>2</i> <i>Chron. 33:6</i></a><i>.</i></script><desc>Some 360 years after David began to rule, Manasseh became king of Judah. His 55-year-long reign was infamous for wickedness, and his detestable practices brought condemnation from Jehovah. Eventually, Manasseh was taken from his homeland and thrown into a Babylonian prison. There he “kept humbling himself greatly” and “kept praying” to God. (<a>2 Chron. 33:12, 13</a>) What was Jehovah’s response to Manasseh’s prayers? “He let himself be entreated by [Manasseh] and He heard his request for favor.” Like David before him, Manasseh recognized the seriousness of his sins and was truly repentant. That is why God forgave Manasseh and restored him to the kingship in Jerusalem. As a result, “Manasseh came to know that Jehovah is the true God.” (<a>2 Chron. 33:13</a>) How heartening it is to have this evidence that our merciful God forgives those who are genuinely repentant! <a><i>w12</i> 11/15 4:11-13</a></desc></text>
<text date='08-01-2014'><date>Wednesday, January 8</date><script><i>I am not lying.—</i><a><i>Gal. 1:20</i></a><i>.</i></script><desc>On occasion, Paul found it necessary to swear to the truthfulness of what he wrote. When some in Corinth accused Paul of being untrustworthy, he wrote in his defense: “God can be relied upon that our speech addressed to you is not Yes and yet No.” (<a>2 Cor. 1:18</a>) At the time of writing that, Paul had left Ephesus and was traveling through Macedonia on his way to Corinth. Originally, he had planned to revisit Corinth before going into Macedonia. (<a>2 Cor. 1:15, 16</a>) But some time after making his original plans, Paul received disturbing news that disunity and immorality were being tolerated in Corinth. (<a>1 Cor. 1:11;</a><a>&#160;5:1</a>) To correct the situation, he wrote strong counsel in his first letter to the Corinthians. Then, instead of sailing directly from Ephesus to Corinth, Paul decided to give his brothers time to apply his counsel so that when he eventually arrived, his visit could be more encouraging.—<a>2 Cor. 1:23</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 10/15 4:6, 7</a></desc></text>
<text date='09-01-2014'><date>Thursday, January 9</date><script><i>You must do according to all that for which the foreigner calls to you.—</i><a><i>1</i> <i>Ki. 8:43</i></a><i>.</i></script><desc>A foreigner is basically someone who is in a land that is not his own or is a person who comes into a community or group from outside of it. This well describes Jehovah’s Witnesses. They owe their primary allegiance to a heavenly government, God’s Kingdom under Christ. Thus, they maintain strict neutrality in political matters, even if some people view them as strangely out of place in today’s society. Foreigners are often recognized by characteristics common to their minority group. It may be the language they speak, their customs, their physical characteristics, even their style or manner of dress. Still, the things they have in common with all other humans, regardless of nationality, are more significant than any of those characteristics. In fact, Jehovah originally purposed that all humans be united as <i>one</i> family under <i>one</i> rulership—<i>his</i> rulership. <a><i>w12</i> 12/15 4:11-13</a></desc></text>
<text date='10-01-2014'><date>Friday, January 10</date><script><i>You do not want to go also, do you?—</i><a><i>John 6:67</i></a><i>.</i></script><desc>Peter responded to Jesus’ question with these words: “Lord, whom shall we go away to? You have sayings of everlasting life; and we have believed and come to know that you are the Holy One of God.” (<a>John 6:68, 69</a>) Did this mean that Peter fully understood all that Jesus had just said about His coming sacrifice? (<a>John 6:53-60</a>) Probably not. Even so, Peter was determined to be loyal to God’s anointed Son. Peter did not reason that Jesus must have the wrong view of things and that if given time, He would recant what He had said. No, Peter humbly recognized that Jesus had “sayings of everlasting life.” Likewise today, how do we react if we encounter a point in our Christian publications from “the faithful steward” that is hard to understand or that does not match with our thinking? We should try hard to get the sense of it rather than merely expecting that there will be a change to conform to our viewpoint.—<a>Luke 12:42</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 4/15 2:10, 11</a></desc></text>
<text date='11-01-2014'><date>Saturday, January 11</date><script><i>All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.—</i><a><i>Rom. 3:23</i></a><i>.</i></script><desc>As Jehovah’s servants, we certainly want to honor and glorify our Creator in everything we do. All too often, however, what we desire to do is not what we do. Paul had to contend with that problem personally. (<a>Rom. 7:21-25</a>) Explaining why we have such a struggle, Paul wrote the words of today’s text. Yes, through inheritance from sinful Adam, mankind became subject to the harsh mastery of ‘King Sin.’ (<a>Rom. 5:12;</a><a>&#160;6:12</a>) What is sin? It is anything contrary to Jehovah’s personality, ways, standards, and will. Sin mars a person’s relationship with God. Sin causes us to miss the mark, even as an archer can shoot an arrow but miss his target. We can sin intentionally or by mistake. (<a>Num. 15:27-31</a>) Sin is deeply ingrained in humans and creates a barrier between them and their Creator. (<a>Ps. 51:5;</a><a>&#160;Isa. 59:2;</a><a>&#160;Col. 1:21</a>) Unquestionably, sin is the worst disability afflicting humankind. <a><i>w12</i> 5/15 4:4, 5</a></desc></text>
<text date='12-01-2014'><date>Sunday, January 12</date><script><i>Write for yourself in a book all the words that I will speak to you.—</i><a><i>Jer. 30:2</i></a><i>.</i></script><desc>Although Jehovah used dictation when precise wording was crucial, in most cases thoughts rather than specific words were miraculously conveyed to the hearts and minds of Bible writers, permitting them to choose their own words to express them. “The congregator sought to find the delightful words and the writing of correct words of truth,” states <a>Ecclesiastes 12:10</a>. The Gospel writer Luke “traced all things from the start with accuracy, to write them in logical order.” (<a>Luke 1:3</a>) God’s spirit ensured that human imperfection did not taint his message. God’s great wisdom is made evident in his use of humans to write the Bible. Words convey not just information but also emotions and feelings. By allowing imperfect men to choose the wording for the ideas they received through holy spirit, God conveyed his message with warmth, variety, and the appeal of human emotions and feelings! <a><i>w12</i> 6/15 4:5-7</a></desc></text>

Our growth in spiritual matters is hindered if we have personal traits that could disrupt peace with our brothers. But by being quick to forgive and by working for the well-being of others, we engender conditions that result in true prosperity. Furthermore, “gifts in men” can be a real force for unity. They have been given to help us to “attain to the oneness in the faith.” (<a>Eph. 4:8,</a><a> 13</a>) When elders work along with us in sacred service and offer perceptive observations based on God’s Word, they assist us to make progress in putting on the new personality. (<a>Eph. 4:22-24</a>) Do you see in their counsel Jehovah’s efforts to prepare you for life in the new world under the rule of his Son? Elders, do you try to readjust others with that objective in view?—<a>Gal. 6:1</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 7/15 4:10-12</a></desc></text>

For your heavenly Father knows you need all these things.—</i><a><i>Matt. 6:31,</i> <i>32</i></a><i>.</i></script><desc>To avoid being strangled by materialism, periodically reappraise your lifestyle. Never would you want to be like Esau, who showed by his actions that he despised spiritual things! (<a>Gen. 25:34;</a><a>&#160;Heb. 12:16</a>) And surely you should not be like the rich man who was invited to sell his belongings, give to the poor, and follow Jesus. Instead of doing so, the man “went away grieved, for he was holding many possessions.” (<a>Matt. 19:21, 22</a>) Ensnared by riches, that man lost out on a great privilege—that of being able to follow the greatest man who ever lived! Be careful not to lose out on the privilege of being a disciple of Jesus Christ. To counteract undue worry about material things, heed the admonition given in today’s text. <a><i>w12</i> 8/15 4:8, 9</a></desc></text>

Each of us can do much good if we display a forgiving spirit when others offend us. God’s Word tells us: “Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely if anyone has a cause for complaint against another. Even as Jehovah freely forgave you, so do you also.” (<a>Col. 3:13</a>) The expression “if anyone has a cause for complaint” suggests that there may be valid reasons for becoming irritated with others. However, rather than being overly concerned about their foibles and disturbing the peace of the congregation, we try to imitate Jehovah and forgive freely, moving on in our service together. We should also pray for holy spirit. (<a>Luke 11:13</a>) God’s spirit will help us display true Christian qualities in dealing with others.—<a>Gal. 5:22, 23</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 10/15 2:1,</a><a>&#160;14, 15</a></desc></text>
<text date='16-01-2014'><date>Thursday, January 16</date><script><i>All authority has been given me.—</i><a><i>Matt. 28:18</i></a><i>.</i></script><desc>The perfect humans, Adam and Eve, were a part of Jehovah’s peaceful and harmonious universal family. They were able to communicate with him personally, worship him, and be blessed by him. That harmonious relationship was interrupted when humans, influenced by Satan, rebelled against Jehovah’s sovereignty. Since 1914, however, the Messianic Kingdom has been taking progressive steps to restore that unity and harmony. (<a>Eph. 1:9, 10</a>) During the Thousand Year Reign, marvelous things presently “unseen” will be brought to reality. (<a>2 Cor. 4:18</a>) Then comes “the end,” that is, the close of Christ’s Millennial Reign. (<a>1 Cor. 15:24</a>) What will happen then? Though given “all authority . . . in heaven and on the earth,” Jesus is not ambitious. He has no intention of usurping Jehovah’s place. He humbly “hands over the kingdom to his God and Father.” He will use his unique position and authority “to the glory of God.”—<a>Phil. 2:9-11</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 9/15 2:17, 18</a></desc></text>

Faithfulness is essential to be an effective, successful steward. If we are faithful, we will be rewarded; that is certain. If we are not faithful, we will suffer loss. (<a>Matt. 25:14-18,</a><a>&#160;23,</a><a>&#160;26,</a><a>&#160;28-30</a>) Jesus pointed out the consequences of unfaithfulness. He said: “A certain man was rich and he had a steward, and this one was accused to him as handling his goods wastefully. So he called him and said to him, ‘What is this I hear about you? Hand in the account of your stewardship, for you can no longer manage the house.’” (<a>Luke 16:1, 2</a>) Because the steward squandered the property of his master, the master dismissed him. What a powerful lesson for us! We certainly never want to be unfaithful in what is asked of us. <a><i>w12</i> 12/15 2:15-17</a></desc></text>
<text date='18-01-2014'><date>Saturday, January 18</date><script><i>You will find refreshment for your souls.—</i><a><i>Matt. 11:29</i></a><i>.</i></script><desc>Jesus assured his followers that by drawing close to him and practicing his teachings, they would be refreshed, for his yoke was kindly and his load was light. People of both sexes and of all ages felt at ease in his presence. (<a>Matt. 11:30</a>) In his association with the common people of Israel, Jesus had compassion for them because they were disadvantaged, and he gave loving attention to their needs. Near Jericho, he encountered a blind beggar named Bartimaeus and his unnamed blind companion. They persistently asked for Jesus’ help, but the crowd sternly urged the men to be quiet. How easy it would have been to ignore the pleas of the blind men! Instead, Jesus asked that they be brought to him, and moved with pity, he restored their sight. Yes, Jesus imitated his Father, Jehovah, by displaying humility and showing mercy to lowly sinners.—<a>Matt. 20:29-34;</a><a>&#160;Mark 10:46-52</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 11/15 2:12, 13</a></desc></text>

He did just so.—</i><a><i>Gen. 6:22</i></a><i>.</i></script><desc>As the work of constructing the ark progressed, Noah and his family must have wondered how God would accomplish his purpose and when the Flood would begin. Yet, their lack of knowledge of these details did not stop them from getting the ark built. Seven days before the floodwaters fell—just enough time for Noah and his family to load the animals into the ark—Jehovah finally told Noah exactly when the Flood would begin. Hence, when the floodgates of the heavens were opened, everything was ready. (<a>Gen. 7:1-5,</a><a> 11</a>) The account of the Flood testifies to Jehovah’s skill not only as a Timekeeper but also as a Deliverer. As he counts down to the end of the present system of things, we can be sure that everything Jehovah has purposed will take place at his appointed time, to the very “day and hour.”—<a>Matt. 24:36;</a><a>&#160;Hab. 2:3</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 4/15 4:7, 8</a></desc></text>

We need to acknowledge our sinful inclinations and work to control them so that we can progress to the point of truly glorifying God. As worshippers of Jehovah, we must continually make a self-examination to determine whether we are measuring up to his righteous standards. (<a>Prov. 28:18;</a><a>&#160;1 Cor. 10:12</a>) Whatever the nature of our sinful tendencies, we must keep on curbing them so that we can reflect God’s glory. Jesus was the only human who ever lived and died without failing to please God and reflect His glory. Although we are not perfect as Jesus was, we can and should strive to follow his example. (<a>1 Pet. 2:21</a>) Jehovah weighs the effort we put forth along with the progress we make, and he blesses our earnest endeavor to bring him glory. <a><i>w12</i> 5/15 4:7, 8</a></desc></text>

Obviously, not all foods and medicines are bad. But if a specific product poses a threat, the government may issue balanced warnings to protect its citizens. If the government did not do so, it would be guilty of negligence. Similarly, God’s Kingdom issues timely warnings about specific moral and spiritual dangers. For instance, the Internet has become a useful way to provide communication, education, and entertainment. God’s organization makes use of the Internet and accomplishes much good with it. However, many sites on the Internet are morally and spiritually dangerous. Web sites that promote pornography pose an obvious threat to the spiritual health of Kingdom citizens.

In addition, family problems and personal dilemmas have brought fear and sorrow. How can we successfully face life with courage? (<a>Rom. 15:4</a>) Consider David. Among other things, he had to put up with the wrath of a king, enemy attacks, the abduction of his wives, treachery in his own ranks, and emotional distress.

As the context shows, Paul wrote these words to encourage fellow believers to focus on the happy outcome of their faithful course. Doing so would also help them to cope with trials and persecution. (<a>2 Cor. 4:8, 9,</a><a>&#160;16-18;</a><a>&#160;5:7</a>) Paul’s admonition contains an important principle: To keep our hope firm, we must look beyond the things that are immediately before us. We need to focus on significant events that are as yet unseen.—<a>Heb. 11:1;</a><a>&#160;12:1, 2</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 9/15 1:1, 2</a></desc></text>

(<a>1 Sam. 17:4</a>, ftn.) Was it David’s courage? Was it his faith in God? Both qualities played a vital role in his act of valor. However, respect for Jehovah and for his great name especially motivated David to take a stand against that towering giant. Indignantly, David asked: “Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he has to taunt the battle lines of the living God?” (<a>1 Sam. 17:26</a>) Relying on the true God, David brought down the Philistine champion with a single slingstone. Not only on that occasion but throughout his life, David trusted in Jehovah and held the divine name in the highest esteem. Indeed, David urged fellow Israelites to ‘boast in Jehovah’s holy name.’—<a>1 Chron. 16:8-10</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 11/15 1:3, 4</a></desc></text>

Ask people that question, and you will find that their answers vary greatly. Many, for example, define success in terms of outstanding achievement in financial, professional, or academic pursuits. Others factor in relationships—how well they relate to family, friends, or workmates. One who serves God might even link success to a position of responsibility in the congregation or to achievements in the ministry. But what matters most is whether Jehovah views us as successful, for our very lives depend on his approval. When giving Joshua the weighty assignment of leading the Israelites into the Promised Land, Jehovah told him to read the Mosaic Law “day and night” and to be careful to obey what was written in it. God assured him: “Then you will make your way successful and then you will act wisely.” (<a>Josh. 1:7, 8</a>) And you know that Joshua did prove to be successful. <a><i>w12</i> 12/15 1:1,</a><a>&#160;3</a></desc></text>

No wonder he waxed poetic! After Jehovah had caused Adam to fall into a deep sleep, He created this beautiful woman from one of the man’s ribs. Adam later named her Eve. God united the two in happy wedlock. Since Jehovah used Adam’s own rib as a base for creating her, Adam and Eve were closer than any present-day husband and wife. In his inimitable wisdom, Jehovah planted within humans the capacity for romantic love—a quality that would draw men and women together. Says <i>The World Book Encyclopedia:</i> “A man and woman who marry hope to share a sexual relationship and a permanent romantic attraction.” That has happened countless times among Jehovah’s people. Of course, marriages are not made in heaven, but God will guide Christians in this and other aspects of life if they pray for direction and are led by his spirit.—<a>Gal. 5:18,</a><a> 25</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 5/15 1:1-3</a></desc></text>

We know the answer—it has been disclosed to us by the “Revealer of secrets,” Jehovah God. He enables us to discern the identity of those governments through the writings of the prophet Daniel and the apostle John. Jehovah revealed to those men a series of visions involving a succession of beasts. He also told Daniel the meaning of a visionary dream depicting an immense metal image. Jehovah had those accounts recorded and preserved in the Bible for our benefit. (<a>Rom. 15:4</a>) He did so to strengthen our hope that soon his Kingdom will crush all human governments. (<a>Dan. 2:44</a>) Taken together, the accounts of Daniel and John not only identify eight kings, or human rulerships, but also show the sequence in which those powers would appear. <a><i>w12</i> 6/15 1:1-3</a></desc></text>

In some countries, private citizens try to increase their safety by installing alarm systems in their homes, as well as extra locks and even electric fences. Many refuse to go out at night or to let their children play outside unattended—day or night. Clearly, freedom is on the wane, and the trend will likely continue. Indeed, the more that people disregard the moral and spiritual boundaries established by God, the more society as a whole suffers. This worsening condition also affects us as Jehovah’s servants.

In this regard, let us compare the attitude of David and Manasseh with that of the wayward people of Israel and Judah. God sent Nathan to confront David and give him an opportunity to change his attitude. David gratefully accepted this offer. When Manasseh found himself in sore straits, he was moved to sincere repentance. Often, however, the inhabitants of Israel and Judah did not repent. Therefore, Jehovah did not forgive them. Instead, he repeatedly had his prophets declare how he viewed their disobedient conduct. Even after the exiles returned from Babylon to their homeland, Jehovah continued to raise up faithful messengers, such as the priest Ezra and the prophet Malachi. When the people acted in harmony with Jehovah’s will, they experienced great joy.—<a>Neh. 12:43-47</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 11/15 4:15</a></desc></text>

The founder of the television network CNN, Ted Turner, comments about his work with a number of talented individuals from various nations: “I came to see those from other countries not as ‘foreigners,’ but as fellow citizens of the planet.” In lands around the globe, only Jehovah’s Witnesses have adopted God’s way of thinking <i>as a group.</i> By learning to see things as Jehovah does, they have been able mentally and emotionally to break down national barriers.

We started communicating again, resumed our family study, and became regular at meetings. Our marriage blossomed anew. In time, my husband again qualified for congregation privileges. It was a hard lesson with a happy outcome.” Whether we are single or married, let us always act courageously and hope in Jehovah. If we are encountering marital difficulties, we should earnestly seek to resolve them, remembering that those united in wedlock are “no longer two, but one flesh.” And let us bear in mind that if we persevere in a divided household despite hardships, we may experience the joy of winning a mate over to true worship. <a><i>w12</i> 5/15 2:19, 20</a></desc></text>

Linguists say that of some 6,700 languages spoken in the world today, approximately 100 cover 90 percent of the world’s population.

For example, a Christian sister might make a male coworker her confidant, even telling him about her marital problems. In another situation, after becoming friendly with a female coworker, a Christian man might reason: “She values my opinion and really listens when I talk to her. And she <i>appreciates</i> me.

(<a>2 Cor. 11:23-27</a>) Despite facing death for serving God, Paul had faith that God would rescue him. (<a>2 Cor. 1:8-10</a>) Not many people have had as many bad experiences as Paul did. Nevertheless, many of us can relate to his feelings and can take comfort from his courageous example. <a><i>w12</i> 10/15 1:6, 7</a></desc></text>

Rather, long before he said anything to Noah about building an ark, God fixed the time for the Flood to begin. How do we know that? From Jehovah’s words in today’s text. This was not a statement regarding the average human lifespan. It was a judicial decree in which Jehovah declared when he would act to cleanse the earth of ungodliness. Since the Flood began in 2370 B.C.E., we infer that God made this pronouncement in 2490 B.C.E. At that time, Noah was 480 years old.

For instance, we need to guard against succumbing to apostasy, a sin that would make us unfit to glorify God. (<a>Deut. 13:6-9</a>) Let us therefore have nothing to do with apostates or anyone who claims to be a brother but who is dishonoring God. This should be the case even if he is a family member. (<a>1 Cor. 5:11</a>) We are not benefited by trying to refute the arguments of apostates or those who are critical of Jehovah’s organization.

Even the challenge that Satan later launched against the rightfulness of Jehovah’s sovereignty gave the Son an opportunity to learn how Jehovah would exercise love, justice, wisdom, and power when He was confronted with a difficult situation. This would, in turn, no doubt have prepared Jesus to cope with the difficulties that he himself later encountered in his ministry on earth.

Why? Because Egypt was the first major power to express enmity toward God’s people. The descendants of Abraham—through whom the promised seed of the woman would come—grew numerous in Egypt. Then, Egypt oppressed Israel. Satan attempted to wipe out God’s people before the seed could arrive. How? By motivating Pharaoh to execute all male Israelite children. Jehovah thwarted that attempt and liberated his people from enslavement to Egypt. (<a>Ex. 1:15-20;</a><a>&#160;14:13</a>) The second head of the beast represents Assyria. This mighty kingdom also attempted to wipe out God’s people by attacking Jerusalem. Satan may have had the goal of obliterating the royal line that would eventually lead to Jesus.

Rather, they appreciate them, recognizing that natural laws are essential for their welfare. Likewise, Jehovah’s moral and spiritual standards, reflected in “the perfect law” of the Christ, are for man’s benefit. (<a>Jas. 1:25</a>) This law also allows us to satisfy all our proper desires without harming ourselves or encroaching on the rights and freedoms of others. The secret, then, to being truly free—being able to do what we desire—is to cultivate the right desires, those that harmonize with Jehovah’s personality and standards. In other words, we have to learn to love what Jehovah loves and to hate what he hates, which the law of freedom helps us to do. <a><i>w12</i> 7/15 1:6, 7</a></desc></text>

If we find ourselves in such a situation, what can we do? We do well to remember that Satan wants to use the tribulations we suffer to undermine our faith.

Since we have faith that God always fulfills his word, it is as though we are holding a valuable deed. Our faith makes us certain that we <i>will</i> see the fulfillment of the Bible-based promises we hope for, and we are <i>sure</i> about spiritual realities, although we cannot see them.

Soon God’s Kingdom will be the only government ruling the earth. It will oversee all aspects of daily life, not only spiritual but also civil. Will you be a good citizen of God’s Kingdom at that time? Now is the time to prove that you will be. In all the decisions you make each day, do all things for Jehovah’s glory and thus prove that you are carrying on as a good citizen of God’s Kingdom.—<a>1 Cor. 10:31</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 8/15 2:15, 16</a></desc></text>

Though we have ample reason for believing that the end of Satan’s system is very near, it can be difficult to wait patiently for that day. Yet, the Bible shows that we must have patience. Like God’s servants before us, we will receive what God has promised if we have strong faith and wait patiently for his time to fulfill those promises. (<a>Heb. 6:11, 12</a>) Jehovah himself has been patient. He could have put an end to wickedness at any time, but he is waiting for the right time. (<a>Rom. 9:20-24</a>) Jehovah has been patient, knowing that it would take time to answer the questions raised by the rebellion in Eden. Having thorough knowledge of the deeds and attitudes of individuals in heaven and on earth, he certainly is acting in our best interests.—<a>Heb. 4:13</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 9/15 3:1-3</a></desc></text>

Proving true to our dedication vow means that we must be faithful in all matters. For example: Are you married? Then continue to honor the precious vow you made to love and cherish your marriage mate. Have you signed a business contract or filled out an application form for theocratic privileges? Then be true to your commitments and to what you have promised. Have you accepted an invitation to a meal by someone of humble means? Then do not cancel it if a seemingly better invitation is made by someone else. Or have you promised someone you met in the house-to-house ministry that you would call again to give that person further spiritual help? Then by all means let your <i>“Yes</i> mean Yes,” and Jehovah will bless your ministry.—<a>Matt. 5:37;</a><a>&#160;Luke 16:10</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 10/15 4:14, 15</a></desc></text>

(<a>1 Pet. 1:3, 4</a>) It was fitting to apply the term “temporary residents” to anointed ones in the first century. As is true of the remnant of this group alive today, their existence on earth was not permanent. The apostle Paul, himself a member of the anointed “little flock,” explained: “As for us, our citizenship exists in the heavens, from which place also we are eagerly waiting for a savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.” (<a>Luke 12:32;</a><a>&#160;Phil. 3:20</a>) Given that their “citizenship exists in the heavens,” at death anointed ones will leave the earthly scene for something far better, immortal life in the heavens. (<a>Phil. 1:21-23</a>) Thus, in a very literal way, they could be termed mere “temporary residents” of the earth under Satan’s control. <a><i>w12</i> 12/15 3:1, 2</a></desc></text>

Jesus was in the district of Galilee when difficulties arose. A few of his apostles were arguing about who was the greatest among them. (<a>Luke 9:46-48</a>) Patiently but firmly, Jesus helped the apostles to see the need for humility. The Greek word translated “lesser one” means someone who is modest, humble, lowly, insignificant, or of little esteem and influence. Jesus used a young child to make clear to his apostles that they should be humble and modest. That admonition is as applicable to true Christians today as it was in the first century. We may find it challenging to conduct ourselves as lesser ones—at least in some circumstances. The human tendency toward pride may motivate us to seek prominence. The competitive environment in which we live and the spirit of the world might influence us to be egotistical, combative, or manipulative. <a><i>w12</i> 11/15 3:1,</a><a>&#160;3</a></desc></text>

They saw firsthand that Jehovah knows how to deliver his people. What lesson can we learn from this account? As events unfold during the great tribulation, Christians will need to heed instructions from God’s Word and organization. For example, Jesus’ command to “begin fleeing to the mountains” has a modern-day application. Just what form our flight will take remains to be seen. However, we can be sure that Jehovah will make clear the meaning of those instructions when the time comes for us to follow them. Since our deliverance will depend on obedience, we do well to ask ourselves: ‘How do I respond to instructions that Jehovah provides for his people now?

With regard to inhabitants of Canaan, the Israelites were commanded: “You must form no marriage alliance with them. Your daughter you must not give to his son, and his daughter you must not take for your son. For he will turn your son from following me, and they will certainly serve other gods; and Jehovah’s anger will indeed blaze against you, and he will certainly annihilate you in a hurry.” (<a>Deut. 7:3, 4</a>) Centuries later, Ezra the priest declared: “You yourselves have acted unfaithfully in that you gave a dwelling to foreign wives so as to add to the guiltiness of Israel.” (<a>Ezra 10:10</a>) If a dedicated servant of Jehovah married an unbeliever, this would be an act of disobedience to God.

The apostle Paul wrote: “Who has come to know the mind of Jehovah, that he may instruct him?” (<a>1 Cor. 2:16</a>) That verse is based on what the prophet Isaiah asked those of his day: “Who has taken the proportions of the spirit of Jehovah, and who as his man of counsel can make him know anything?” (<a>Isa. 40:13</a>) The answer, of course, is no one. No wonder that applying Scriptural counsel on marriage, children, entertainment, association, industriousness, honesty, and morality brings superior results! We never get bad advice from the Bible.

This should at once impress on us the direction a husband should give and the love and care he needs to exercise—as well as the subjection the wife should manifest—within the marital union. (<a>Eph. 5:22-32</a>) When Paul wrote: “In this <i>way</i> husbands ought to be loving their wives as their own bodies,” about which “way” was he speaking? (<a>Eph. 5:28</a>) His preceding words drew attention to the way in which “Christ also loved the congregation and delivered up himself for it, . . . cleansing it with the bath of water by means of the word.” Indeed, to work in harmony with Jehovah’s purpose for gathering all things together again in the Christ, a husband must be alert to feed his family spiritually. <a><i>w12</i> 7/15 4:15</a></desc></text>

Never think that your theocratic privileges are more important than your spouse. Moreover, be aware that frequently spending time away from your mate for nonessential activities may indicate a weakness in your marriage and can lead to temptation and possibly to serious sin. If you are an elder, though, what about the flock? The apostle Peter wrote: “Shepherd the flock of God in your care, not under compulsion, but willingly; neither for love of dishonest gain, but eagerly.” (<a>1 Pet. 5:2</a>) Congregation members in your care certainly should not be ignored. However, you should not fulfill your role as a shepherd at the expense of your role as a husband. It would be pointless—even dangerous—to focus all your attention on feeding the congregation while your mate is “starving” at home. <a><i>w12</i> 8/15 4:14, 15</a></desc></text>

In one Nazi prison camp, for example, at first the brothers had only one copy of the Bible. So they prayed for further spiritual food. Shortly thereafter they learned that a newly imprisoned brother had managed to smuggle a few new issues of <i>The Watchtower</i> into the camp inside his wooden leg. Among the survivors was an anointed brother named Ernst Wauer, who later recalled: “Jehovah helped us in a marvelous way to commit to memory the fortifying thoughts in the articles.” Then he said: “Nowadays, it is so easy to get spiritual food, but do we always appreciate it?” <a><i>w12</i> 9/15 4:14</a></desc></text>

Gaining an accurate knowledge of the truth, Paul came to value the ransom, the Christian ministry, the hope of life in heaven—things that the world largely ignores.

David prayed to Jehovah God: “Teach me to do your will.” (<a>Ps. 143:5,</a><a> 10</a>) Rather than relying on his own ideas or giving in to another person’s urgings, David was eager to be taught by God. He ‘meditated on all of Jehovah’s activity and willingly kept himself concerned with the work of God’s own hands.’ We ourselves can discern God’s will by delving into the Scriptures and meditating on the many Biblical accounts of Jehovah’s dealings with humans. <a><i>w12</i> 11/15 1:10, 11</a></desc></text>

The wisdom, courage, and faith shown by Joshua during the long conquest of Canaan must have strengthened the Israelites. In addition to valor in battle, however, they needed what might be called quiet courage to do what Joshua urged them to do. At the end of his life, in his farewell address, he said: “You must be very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses by never turning away from it.” (<a>Josh. 23:6</a>) We too need the courage to obey Jehovah at all times. This includes occasions when mere men demand that we act contrary to God’s will.

No matter how much we know, it should humble us to realize that there is no limit to what can be learned about Jehovah, his works, and his ways. It is noteworthy that Jehovah himself displays humility. Consider this: “We are God’s fellow workers.” (<a>1 Cor. 3:9</a>) Imagine that!

A literal light may reveal a danger or an obstacle on our pathway, but it does not remove it. We must act wisely on what we see. In a similar way, Jehovah reveals to us the basic meaning of world events. He alerts us to the dangers of this system of things. He provides us with Bible principles that always work, but we must apply what we learn. When we do, we can act with more wisdom than either our enemies or our teachers. (<a>Ps. 119:98, 99,</a><a>&#160;130</a>) David’s words at <a>Psalm 27:1</a> show that he must have recalled how Jehovah had delivered, or saved, him on previous occasions.

But was enjoyment of these things Moses’ objective? Because of the training that he received from his real parents early in life, Moses likely knew what Jehovah had promised his ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Moses exercised faith in those promises. He must have thought carefully about his future and his loyalty to Jehovah. So when the time came to choose between being an Egyptian prince or an Israelite slave, what did he decide? Moses chose “to be ill-treated with the people of God rather than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin.” (<a>Heb. 11:24-26</a>) Later, he followed Jehovah’s guidance regarding how he should use his life.—<a>Ex. 3:2,</a><a>&#160;6-10</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 6/15 3:5, 6</a></desc></text>

His goal is not necessarily to destroy them, as a big-game hunter kills prey. Rather, the Devil’s main goal is to capture his quarry alive and use the person as he sees fit. (<a>2 Tim. 2:24-26</a>) To catch prey alive, a trapper may use a snare of some sort. He may try to get the animal to come out into the open where he can capture it with a noose. Or he may use a hidden trap that has a trigger and takes the animal by surprise. The Devil uses similar snares to catch God’s servants alive. If we want to avoid being caught, we must be alert and heed warning signs indicating that one of Satan’s snares, or traps, is nearby.

Much of the danger centers on two aspects—what <i>type</i> you choose and how much <i>time</i> you spend on it. Today, much of what is available glorifies things that God hates, including violence, spiritism, and illicit sex. Therefore, you need to scrutinize the type of recreation and entertainment that you engage in and the effect it has on you.

He implanted a sexual need in humans so that they would “be fruitful and become many.” (<a>Gen. 1:28</a>) God understands feelings of loneliness, for prior to creating the first woman, he said the words of today’s text. Jehovah is also fully aware of the joy possible within the bonds of matrimony. (<a>Prov. 5:15-18</a>) Because of sin and imperfection, no present-day marriage is perfect. Among Jehovah’s servants, however, wedlock can result in true happiness if God’s Word is followed. For instance, consider Paul’s clear counsel on intimate relations in marriage.

Do you see in that account the Father’s personality? It reminds us that God has not only the unlimited power to wipe wickedness from the face of the earth but also the ardent desire to do so. This depiction of Jesus’ strong reaction to wrongdoing reveals how the Father must feel as he looks at the wickedness that is rampant on earth today. How reassuring that is to us when we are coping with injustices! <a><i>w12</i> 4/15 1:11</a></desc></text>

It is natural for a God-fearing husband to love his wife and protect her physically and spiritually. She yearns for his love, and that requires that she be lovable. “The truly wise woman has built up her house,” says <a>Proverbs 14:1</a>, “but the foolish one tears it down with her own hands.” A wise and loving wife contributes greatly to the success and happiness of her family. She also shows that she really appreciates God’s gift of marriage. Husbands and wives who base their union on Jesus’ example in dealing with his congregation show gratitude for God’s gift of marriage. (<a>Eph. 5:22-25</a>) What blessings spouses enjoy when they truly love each other and never let pride, the childish silent treatment, or other unchristian traits mar their marriage! <a><i>w12</i> 5/15 1:12,</a><a>&#160;14, 15</a></desc></text>

Jehovah disclosed not only the manner in which the city of Babylon would be defeated but also the name of the conqueror. That leader was Cyrus the Persian. (<a>Isa. 44:28–45:2</a>) Daniel received two other visions regarding the Medo-Persian World Power. In one, the kingdom was depicted as being like a bear that was raised up on one side. In a separate vision, Daniel saw this dual world power symbolized by a two-horned ram. (<a>Dan. 8:3,</a><a> 20</a>) Jehovah used the Medo-Persian Empire to fulfill prophecy by overthrowing Babylon and restoring the Israelites to their homeland. (<a>2 Chron. 36:22, 23</a>) However, this same power later came close to eradicating God’s people.—<a>Esther 1:1-3;</a><a>&#160;3:8, 9;</a><a>&#160;8:3,</a><a>&#160;9-14</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 6/15 1:12, 13</a></desc></text>

Among other things, it produces within us qualities that are essential to freedom—“love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith, mildness, self-control.” (<a>Gal. 5:22, 23</a>) Without those qualities, especially love, no society can be truly free—a fact that is obvious in the world today. Interestingly, after listing the spirit’s fruitage, the apostle Paul added: “Against such things there is no law.” What did he mean? The fruitage of God’s spirit is not restricted by any law that can limit its growth. (<a>Gal. 5:18</a>) After all, what would be the point of such a law? It is Jehovah’s will that we cultivate Christlike qualities forever and display them without restriction. Those who are enthralled by the world’s spirit and who indulge their fleshly desires may think they are free. (<a>2 Pet. 2:18, 19</a>) The reality, however, is quite the opposite. <a><i>w12</i> 7/15 1:13, 14</a></desc></text>

That is what Joshua was told to do when he became Moses’ successor: “Be courageous and very strong to take care to do according to all the law that Moses my servant commanded you. . . . This book of the law should not depart from your mouth, and you must in an undertone read in it day and night, in order that you may take care to do according to all that is written in it; for then you will make your way successful and then you will act wisely.” (<a>Josh. 1:7, 8</a>) Joshua followed that counsel, and ‘his way was successful.’ If we do likewise, we will have greater courage and success in God’s service. Joshua must have been greatly strengthened when he heard Jehovah’s words, as recorded in today’s text. Jehovah is with us too.

Nearly eight million people now accept “the true knowledge,” applying it in their lives. (<a>Dan. 12:4;</a><a>&#160;Isa. 60:22</a>) This is particularly impressive, since Jesus foretold that his disciples would be “objects of hatred by all people” because of his name. He added that his followers would be persecuted, imprisoned, and even killed. (<a>Luke 21:12-17</a>) Despite the opposition of Satan, his demons, and opposers among mankind, Jehovah’s people have enjoyed phenomenal success in carrying out their commission to make disciples. Today, they are preaching in “all the inhabited earth,” from tropical jungles to frigid tundra, in mountains, in deserts, in cities, and in the most remote countryside.

However, havoc is also to come Satan’s way.

The nations will have to realize that their crushing defeat is brought about by the order of Jehovah himself.

Notably, many brothers in these lands have shown remarkable resilience. This does not mean that it was easy. Yet in each case, they put the disaster behind them and moved on in Jehovah’s service. In September 2009, over 80 percent of Manila, Philippines, was flooded by torrential rains. A wealthy man who lost much said, “The flood was a great equalizer, bringing difficulties and sufferings to both the rich and the poor.” Building one’s life around material things, which can so quickly disappear, often brings disappointment. How much wiser it is to center our life on our relationship with Jehovah, which can remain intact no matter what happens around us!—<a>Heb. 13:5, 6</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 10/15 1:12, 13</a></desc></text>

It may be difficult for those who have never experienced such a loss to appreciate how devastating it can be. Nevertheless, it would be unwise to let the improper course of a disfellowshipped family member distance you from Jehovah. How, then, can you cope with the profound grief that arises when a family member leaves Jehovah? Do not blame yourself for what happened. Jehovah has put a choice before humans, and each dedicated and baptized family member must “carry his own load” of responsibility. (<a>Gal. 6:5</a>) Ultimately, Jehovah holds the sinner—not you—responsible for his or her choice. (<a>Ezek. 18:20</a>) Also, do not blame others. Respect Jehovah’s arrangement for discipline.

My betrayer has drawn near.” Immediately, Judas appeared in the garden with his coconspirators, “and going straight up to Jesus he said: ‘Good day, Rabbi!’ and kissed him very tenderly.” (<a>Matt. 26:46-50;</a><a>&#160;Luke 22:47,</a><a> 52</a>) Judas “betrayed righteous blood” and handed Jesus over to Christ’s enemies. And for what did money-loving Judas do that? For a mere 30 pieces of silver! (<a>Matt. 27:3-5</a>) The name Judas has been synonymous with “traitor” ever since, especially one who betrays another under the guise of friendship. Judas met a shameful end because of his having turned traitor against the anointed of Jehovah.

Christians who refuse to give up quickly on a difficult marriage often enjoy a fine reward. Consider what can happen in a religiously divided household. The apostle Peter wrote: “You wives, be in subjection to your own husbands, in order that, if any are not obedient to the word, they may be won without a word through the conduct of their wives, because of having been eyewitnesses of your chaste conduct together with deep respect.” (<a>1 Pet. 3:1, 2</a>) Yes, because of his mate’s fine conduct, an unbeliever may embrace the true faith!

This last world power may be weaker than that represented by the legs of iron, but it will not disintegrate on its own. (<a>Dan. 2:33, 34</a>) Does the number of toes of the image have special meaning? Consider: In other visions, Daniel mentions specific numbers—for example, the number of horns on the heads of various beasts. Those numbers are significant. However, when describing the image, Daniel does not mention the number of toes. Therefore, the number seems no more significant than the fact that the image had multiple arms, hands, fingers, legs, and feet. Daniel does specifically mention that the toes would be made of iron and clay. From his description, we can conclude that the Anglo-American World Power is the one that will be dominating when the “stone” representing God’s Kingdom hits the feet of the image. <a><i>w12</i> 6/15 2:10, 11</a></desc></text>

(<a>1 Ki. 3:7-9</a>) Jehovah answered that sincere request, and he will do the same for you, whether you are young or old. Of course, Jehovah will not give you miraculous insight and wisdom. But he will make you wise if you earnestly study his Word, pray for holy spirit, and take full advantage of the spiritual provisions made available through the Christian congregation.

Many citizens of human governments <i>say</i> that they agree with the laws and standards of the country in which they live. However, when they find a requirement to be inconvenient and feel that nobody is looking, they break the law. Often, these people are “men pleasers.” (<a>Col. 3:22</a>) Kingdom citizens live by a higher standard. We gladly obey God’s laws, even when no other human is looking. Why? Because we love the Lawmaker. (<a>Luke 10:27</a>) A foundation law of God’s Kingdom is that all citizens imitate Christ. (<a>1 Pet. 2:21</a>) Regarding Jesus’ example, the apostle Paul wrote: “Let each of us please his neighbor in what is good for his upbuilding. For even the Christ did not please himself.” (<a>Rom. 15:2, 3</a>) For the sake of peace in the congregation, a mature Christian is willing to yield without resentment to the consciences of others.—<a>Rom. 14:19-21</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 8/15 2:7, 8</a></desc></text>

No. In the first century, an issue arose over which there was much disputing. The brothers “arranged for Paul and Barnabas and some others of them to go up to the apostles and older men in Jerusalem regarding this dispute.” (<a>Acts 15:2</a>) No doubt each of those brothers had an opinion on the subject and an idea of how the matter might be handled. However, once each one expressed his thought and a spirit-directed decision was made, the brothers did not continue to bring up their individual opinions. After the letter with the decision reached the congregations, “they rejoiced over the encouragement” and were “made firm in the faith.” (<a>Acts 15:31;</a><a>&#160;16:4, 5</a>) Likewise today, once we bring a matter to the attention of the responsible brothers, we should be content to leave it to their prayerful consideration. <a><i>w12</i> 10/15 2:12, 13</a></desc></text>

However, “David did not consent to drink it, but poured it out to Jehovah.” (<a>1 Chron. 11:15-18</a>) David knew from the Law that blood should be poured out to Jehovah and not eaten. He also understood why this should be done. David knew that “the soul of the flesh is in the blood.” However, this was water, not blood. Why did David refuse to drink it? He appreciated the principle behind the legal requirement. To David, the water was as precious as the blood of the three men. Therefore, it was unthinkable for him to drink the water.

Jesus made a point similar to the one Solomon made in the book of Ecclesiastes—worldly treasures are not lasting. As you have likely seen in the world around you, all such treasures are perishable and can be easily lost. Professor F. Dale Bruner writes of such treasures: “It is well known that fame is fickle. Last Saturday’s hero is next season’s has-been. This year’s financial success is next year’s bankruptcy. . . . [Jesus] loves human beings. He urges them to avoid the inevitable despair that comes with evanescent glory. It doesn’t last.

Invading one house after another and, dragging out both men and women, he would turn them over to prison.” (<a>Acts 8:3</a>) As a devout Jew, Saul believed that it was his God-given duty to stamp out Christianity. So he pursued the Christians with brutal cruelty, “breathing threat and murder against . . . both men and women,” trying to destroy them.

For example, Jesus said: “You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.” (<a>Matt. 22:37</a>) In this instance, “heart” refers to the emotions, desires, and feelings of the inner person. By mentioning heart, soul, and mind separately, Jesus emphasized that we must express our love for God in our feelings as well as by the way we lead our life and use our mental faculties.

For the answer, we must turn to what God has revealed in the pages of his Word, the Bible. When we examine it, we find prophecies that have always been fulfilled right on time! Jehovah can reveal what is yet to occur because he can foresee the future accurately. Moreover, what the Scriptures foretell happens on time because Jehovah God can cause events to take place according to his purpose and timetable. Jehovah wants his worshippers to understand Scriptural prophecies and benefit from them.

Obtaining life’s necessities requires that we make some plans for the future. (<a>Prov. 6:6-11</a>) But how wise would it be to invest a lot of time and energy in pursuits that are not of lasting value? Granted, Jehovah’s organization continues to plan for new Kingdom Halls, branch facilities, and other theocratic projects. These endeavors, however, do have a future because their objective is that of promoting Kingdom interests.

The disciple James likened the tongue to a fire. (<a>Jas. 3:6-8</a>) If we fail to control our tongue, we could start a figurative wildfire in the congregation. How might this happen? Consider the following scenario: At a congregation meeting, an announcement is made that a certain sister has been appointed a regular pioneer.

But things changed with the introduction of human sin and imperfection. Eventually, when lying and deception were common among men, it became necessary for them to swear to the truthfulness of important matters. Making oaths was a legal tool that the patriarch Abraham used to good advantage on at least three occasions. (<a>Gen. 21:22-24;</a><a>&#160;24:2-4,</a><a> 9</a>) This occurred, for example, when he returned from defeating the king of Elam and his allies. (<a>Gen. 14:17-20</a>) When the king of Sodom wanted to reward Abraham for rescuing the king’s people from the invading armies, Abraham swore: “From a thread to a sandal lace, no, I shall take nothing from anything that is yours, in order that you may not say, ‘It was I who made Abram rich.’”—<a>Gen. 14:21-23</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 10/15 3:4, 5</a></desc></text>

God’s example of humility had a tremendous effect on the psalmist David. He sang to Jehovah: “It is your humility that makes me great.” (<a>2 Sam. 22:36</a>) David attributed any greatness he had in Israel to Jehovah’s humility—to God’s condescending, or humbling himself, to pay attention to him. (<a>Ps. 113:5-7</a>) Is it any different with us? In the way of qualities, abilities, and privileges, what do any of us have that we “did not receive” from Jehovah?

Even the desire for sexual pleasure with one’s marriage mate is fitting and has its place. (<a>1 Cor. 7:3-5</a>) Peter, though, correctly limited the “fleshly desires” of which he was speaking to those that “carry on a conflict against the soul.” Making it obvious just what is meant, some Bible translations speak of “fleshly lusts” (<i>King James Version</i>) or “sinful desires” (<i>New International Version</i>). Clearly, any human desire that conflicts with Jehovah’s expressed purpose and that could negatively affect one’s good relationship with God must be kept in check.

(<a>Prov. 3:27</a>) Whenever an elder does that, he tells his brothers, in effect: ‘I noticed what you did. I care about you.’ And fellow believers definitely need to hear the elders’ reassuring words. A sister in her mid-50’s spoke for many when she said: “At work I seldom get a compliment. There’s a cold and competitive climate. So when an elder commends me for something I’ve done for the congregation, it’s so refreshing, so energizing! It makes me feel loved by my heavenly Father.” A brother who received heartfelt commendation said: “The elder’s words gave me a real boost!” Indeed, by sincerely commending fellow believers, an elder lifts their spirit and deepens their joy.

Upon gaining their heavenly position, these devoted ones will help obedient humans to reach perfection and endless life. Clearly, even while he is patiently waiting, Jehovah has been working to fulfill his promises—for our good. It can be challenging to keep this in mind as we grow older or suffer in this wicked system. We might become discouraged or feel that God is slow to fulfill his promises.

The psalmist David pondered this question, saying to Jehovah the words of today’s text. Perhaps his question was prompted by David’s own experience. In him, the youngest son of Jesse, Jehovah had found “a man agreeable to his heart” and had taken him “from following the flock to become a leader” over Israel. (<a>1 Sam. 13:14;</a><a>&#160;2 Sam. 7:8</a>) Imagine how David must have felt upon realizing that the Creator of the universe had paid attention to his private meditations, the musings of a shepherd boy!

Some who have become Christians have had the faith, courage, and moral strength to make similar changes to please God. After Joshua’s death, the Moabitess Ruth courageously took her stand for true worship. When her widowed mother-in-law, Naomi, urged Ruth to return to her own people, the Moabitess replied: “Do not plead with me to abandon you, to turn back from accompanying you . . . Your people will be my people, and your God my God.” (<a>Ruth 1:16</a>) Ruth meant that. In time, Naomi’s kinsman Boaz married Ruth, who bore a son and became an ancestress of David and of Jesus.

When he grew old, “his wives themselves had inclined his heart to follow other gods.” (<a>1 Ki. 11:1-5</a>) If unbelievers make romantic advances toward us, does our response reflect a viewpoint like that of David or one like Solomon’s? True worshippers are told to marry “only in the Lord.” (<a>1 Cor. 7:39</a>) If a Christian chooses to get married, he or she should marry a fellow believer.

During World War I, Britain and the United States forged a special partnership. Yes, the fifth part of Daniel’s image is the Anglo-American World Power. That the feet and toes are made up of iron and clay pictures the weakened state of the Anglo-American World Power. The same prophecy indicates that God’s Kingdom, pictured by a large stone, was cut from the mountain of Jehovah’s sovereignty in 1914. That stone is now hurtling toward its target—the feet of the image. At Armageddon, the feet and the rest of the image will be smashed.

As a result, we’re known as the family that has a lot of money rather than as the family that encourages others in spiritual pursuits.

Note some expressions of the strong conviction of God’s servants. David said: “Jehovah is my strength and my shield. In him my heart has trusted, and I have been helped, so that my heart exults.” (<a>Ps. 28:7</a>) Paul expressed his unwavering confidence, saying: “In all these things we are coming off completely victorious through him that loved us.” (<a>Rom. 8:37</a>) What is evident in these expressions?

Note, though, that Jesus was not condemning all such effort. Rather, he was exhorting his disciples to <i>redirect</i> their effort, admonishing them to store up imperishable “treasures in heaven.” (<a>Matt. 6:20</a>) Our foremost desire should be to strive to be a success as Jehovah would view it. Yes, Jesus’ words remind us that we have a choice as to what we will pursue. The fact is, though, that we will pursue what is in our heart, what is of value to us. If it is in our heart to please Jehovah, we can trust that he will see to it that we have the things we need.

Through the preaching of the good news and the operation of holy spirit. If you are a dedicated Christian, you too were drawn by God to true worship. Just as our heavenly Father saw something valuable in the heart of Lydia, he saw something good in you. When you began listening to the good news, Jehovah helped you to grasp it by supplying holy spirit. (<a>Acts 16:13-15;</a><a>&#160;1 Cor. 2:11, 12</a>) When you endeavored to apply what you learned, he blessed your efforts to do his will. When you dedicated your life to him, his heart rejoiced. Indeed, ever since you started on the road to life, Jehovah has been with you each step of the way. Having helped us to begin walking with him, Jehovah does not now leave us to our own devices to remain faithful.

There they would “serve the king of Babylon seventy years.” Babylonian armies destroyed Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E., and Jews from Judah were indeed deported to Babylon. But what was to happen at the end of 70 years? Jeremiah prophesied: “This is what Jehovah has said, ‘In accord with the fulfilling of seventy years at Babylon I shall turn my attention to you people, and I will establish toward you my good word in bringing you back to this place.’” (<a>Jer. 25:11;</a><a>&#160;29:10</a>) This prophecy was fulfilled right on time—in 537 B.C.E. <a><i>w12</i> 5/15 3:7</a></desc></text>

Paul recognized that a career in the Jewish system had no value from Jehovah’s point of view; it had no future. (<a>Matt. 24:2</a>) This former Pharisee went so far as to say that compared with his new, enlightened understanding of God’s purposes and the privilege of the Christian ministry, what he once thought was important he now considered to be “a lot of refuse.” Paul abandoned his pursuits in Judaism and dedicated the rest of his days on earth to preaching the good news.—<a>Phil. 3:4-8,</a><a>&#160;15;</a><a>&#160;Acts 9:15</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 6/15 3:10, 11</a></desc></text>

(<a>Heb. 10:10</a>) This great spiritual temple is the arrangement Jehovah has made so that we, through our faith in Jesus’ ransom sacrifice, can approach God acceptably. How do we worship there? By praying “with true hearts in the full assurance of faith”; by declaring our hope publicly without wavering; and by considering, inciting, and encouraging fellow worshippers at our congregation meetings and during family worship.

If we have a tendency to be cynical, it is good to remember that the Devil questioned the motives of God’s faithful servant Job. (<a>Job 1:10, 11</a>) Rather than being suspicious of our brother, we would do well to consider why we are critical of him. Do we really have good reason for being that way? Or has our heart been poisoned by the unloving spirit so prevalent during these last days? (<a>2 Tim. 3:1-4</a>) Another reason why we might be critical of others is that we desire to make our own accomplishments more noticeable.

The first major convention that the Bible Students held after World War I was in 1919 in Cedar Point, Ohio, U.S.A. That gathering, attended by some 7,000, was marked by the launching of a global preaching campaign. In 1922, during a nine-day convention at the same location, dramatic impetus was given to this activity by Joseph F. Rutherford, who told his attentive audience: “The world must know that Jehovah is God and that Jesus Christ is King of kings and Lord of lords. . . .

Analyzing and understanding the reason for your reaction will allow you to consider what would be the best and Scripturally proper response.

Perhaps the best-known example was in God’s dealings with Abraham. Over a period of many years, Jehovah had made several covenant promises to Abraham that when combined show that the promised Seed would descend from Abraham through his son Isaac. (<a>Gen. 12:1-3,</a><a> 7;</a><a>&#160;13:14-17;</a><a>&#160;15:5,</a><a>&#160;18;</a><a>&#160;21:12</a>) Then Jehovah put Abraham to a severe test, commanding him to offer up his beloved son. Without delay, Abraham obeyed and was about to sacrifice Isaac when an angel of God stopped him. Then God made this oath: “By myself I do swear . . . that by reason of the fact that you have done this thing and you have not withheld your son, your only one, I shall surely bless you and I shall surely multiply your seed like the stars of the heavens and like the grains of sand that are on the seashore.”—<a>Gen. 22:1-3,</a><a>&#160;9-12,</a><a>&#160;15-17</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 10/15 3:6</a></desc></text>

Simply because they differ from their neighbors, they may even be viewed as if they were evildoers. Their speech, their actions, their dress, perhaps even their appearance may be somewhat different. But when they do good works, that is to say, when their conduct is fine, negative comments about their being different are proved groundless. Similarly, true Christians differ from many of their neighbors in certain respects, as in conversation or choice of entertainment. Their dress and grooming often identify them as being different from most in the community. These differences have sometimes led misinformed individuals to accuse them of being, as it were, evildoers. However, other people may praise them for their way of life.

By taking the initiative to reach out to those who need encouragement. (<a>Acts 20:28</a>) When elders do so, they imitate spiritual shepherds of old. Note, for instance, what the faithful overseer Nehemiah did when he saw that some of his Jewish brothers had grown spiritually weak. The account states that he immediately rose up and encouraged them. (<a>Neh. 4:14</a>) Today, elders want to do the same. They ‘rise up’—take the initiative—to help fellow believers to be firm in faith. To give such personal encouragement, they visit their brothers and sisters in their homes if circumstances allow. During such shepherding visits, they want to “impart some spiritual gift” to them. <a><i>w13</i> 1/15 5:10</a></desc></text>

For instance, the first commandment began: “I am <i>Jehovah</i> your God.” (<a>Ex. 20:1-17</a>) God’s name lives on because the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has preserved his Word and his name despite all satanic efforts to eliminate them. (<a>Ps. 73:28</a>) In his Word, Jehovah has also preserved the truth. Though religious error abounds worldwide, how thankful we are that God has given us spiritual light and truth!

Rather, it can be likened to a marathon wherein endurance is necessary for victory. The Bible tells us to run in this figurative race. (<a>1 Cor. 9:25-27</a>) The prize is everlasting life, either in heaven for anointed Christians or on earth for the rest of the participants. Unlike most athletic contests, this race allows for all who enter and who endure to the end to win the prize. (<a>Matt. 24:13</a>) Contestants lose only if they fail to run according to the rules or do not cross the finish line. Furthermore, this is the only race that offers the prize of everlasting life.

(<a>Matt. 27:26</a>) But that wound soon healed because Jehovah resurrected Jesus. The religious leaders of Israel conspired with Rome against Jesus, and the majority of the nation also rejected him. (<a>Acts 2:22, 23</a>) Thus, Jehovah abandoned natural Israel as his people. He now chose a new nation, “the Israel of God.” (<a>Gal. 3:26-29;</a><a>&#160;6:16</a>) That nation was the congregation of anointed Christians made up of both Jews and Gentiles.

Such a blessing, though, can be related to what truly is the basis for success, our obedience and faithfulness to God. And we must endure in being faithful. Jesus said: “He that has endured to the end is the one that will be saved.” (<a>Matt. 10:22</a>) Would you not agree that being saved is an undeniable evidence of success? Strive to be faithful whatever your circumstances are. It is worth the effort. Be confident that Jehovah will bless you richly—now and throughout eternity. Never forget the words that Jesus directed to anointed Christians: “Prove yourself faithful even to death, and I will give you the crown of life.” (<a>Rev. 2:10</a>) That indeed is real success! <a><i>w12</i> 12/15 1:17,</a><a>&#160;19</a></desc></text>

For example, consider High Priest Jehoiada and his wife, Jehosheba. After King Ahaziah died, Athaliah, his mother, killed the remaining royal offspring except Jehoash and seized the throne. Jehoiada and Jehosheba had taken the risk of rescuing Ahaziah’s son Jehoash and had kept him hidden for six years. In the seventh year, Jehoiada had Jehoash proclaimed king and had Athaliah put to death. (<a>2 Ki. 11:1-16</a>) Jehoiada later supported King Jehoash in repairing the temple. And when Jehoiada died at 130 years of age, he was buried with the kings. Moreover, the courageous deeds of Jehoiada and his wife preserved the royal line from David to the Messiah. <a><i>w13</i> 1/15 1:11</a></desc></text>

(<a>Gen. 10:10</a>) It was possibly under his direction that the building of Babel and its tower began about 2269 B.C.E. Contrary to Jehovah’s will that mankind spread throughout the earth, those builders said: “Come on! Let us build ourselves a city and also a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a celebrated name for ourselves, for fear we may be scattered over all the surface of the earth.” But that scheme had to be abandoned when God “confused the language of all the earth” and scattered the would-be tower builders. (<a>Gen. 11:1-4,</a><a>&#160;8, 9</a>) If Satan had thus planned to start one religion with everyone worshipping him, his plot was an utter failure.

Then personal study is a must. Use the Bible and our theocratic publications to help you do research, meditate, and identify potential stumbling blocks. Beg for holy spirit to give you the spiritual stamina you need. Remember, no runner is doomed to fail in the race for life just because he stumbles or falls on occasion. He can get up and get back into the race. He may even use potential stumbling stones as stepping stones, learning valuable lessons from any challenge to his faith. The Bible describes participation in the race for everlasting life as active, not passive. It is not like getting on a bus that simply carries those on board to victory. We must <i>run</i> the race for life ourselves. As we do, we can be confident of Jehovah’s continued blessings now and unending blessings to come for all who finish the race.—<a>Jas. 1:12</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 3/15 1:20, 21</a></desc></text>

Indeed, by what we put first in our life, we make manifest what we are desiring, thinking, and planning deep down in our heart. Examining our priorities in life is thus a tangible way to check whether we are serving God with a complete heart. (<a>1 Chron. 28:9</a>) We have wisely accepted Jesus’ invitation to be his followers and are now serving Jehovah every day. In this way, we demonstrate how we feel in our heart about Jehovah. Yet, even though we are active in the congregation, we still need to be aware of a potential risk to our heart condition. What is it? Jesus revealed that danger, saying: “No man that has put his hand to a plow and looks at the things behind is well fitted for the kingdom of God.”—<a>Luke 9:62</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 4/15 3:8,</a><a>&#160;10</a></desc></text>

(<a>Eccl. 5:4-6</a>) In the sense that he is the Originator of the marital arrangement, Jehovah has “yoked together” those united in wedlock. (<a>Mark 10:9</a>) This yoke exists in God’s sight regardless of the laws that sanctioned the wedding. Servants of Jehovah should view marriage as a binding arrangement whether they were his worshippers at the time of their wedding or not. When a Christian’s marriage succeeds, it is a joy and brings honor to Jehovah. If it fails, it is a heartache at best. An unmarried Christian who is contemplating wedlock is in a position to get marriage off to a fine start by following God’s guidance. On the other hand, a person who makes an unwise decision when choosing a husband or a wife may experience dissatisfaction and grief. <a><i>w12</i> 5/15 2:1,</a><a>&#160;3</a></desc></text>

After being baptized, Jesus devoted the rest of his life on earth to preaching the good news and honoring Jehovah. The obvious conclusion for a Christian who recognizes Jehovah as his Master is that serving Him should have priority in his life. Is it yours? (<a>Ps. 71:15;</a><a>&#160;145:2</a>) Over the years, Jehovah’s organization has repeatedly encouraged Christians to consider prayerfully whether they could pioneer. For various reasons, the circumstances of some faithful servants of Jehovah do not allow them to devote themselves to the preaching work an average of 70 hours per month. They should not feel bad about this. (<a>1 Tim. 5:8</a>) But what about you? Have you seriously considered entering the regular pioneer ranks? By pursuing a theocratic career, you will be pursuing truly worthwhile and lasting goals. And you will be following Jesus’ perfect example. <a><i>w12</i> 6/15 3:12, 13,</a><a>&#160;15</a></desc></text>

If, for instance, we are concerned about how to provide materially for our family, can we not be certain that Jehovah will help us? (<a>Heb. 13:5, 6</a>) He understands the circumstances and needs of all his loyal servants. Jehovah has promised to help, protect, and deliver his people, as a group, physically and spiritually, and we trust in him. (<a>Ps. 37:28;</a><a>&#160;91:1-3</a>) The crowd that survive “the great tribulation” must indeed be great.

In fact, Pilate said that Jesus had done “nothing deserving of death.” Nevertheless, Pilate condemned him to death. Why? Because Pilate succumbed to pressure from the mob. (<a>Luke 23:15,</a><a>&#160;21-25</a>) “If you release this man, you are not a friend of Caesar,” cried those opposers, thus applying pressure in order to get their way. (<a>John 19:12</a>) Pilate may have feared that he would lose his position—or possibly his life—if he sided with Christ. So he allowed himself to be led into doing the Devil’s will. Pilate had little knowledge about Christ. Still, he knew that Jesus was innocent and was no ordinary man. But Pilate lacked humility and love for the true God. The Devil easily caught him alive. <a><i>w12</i> 8/15 3:8, 9,</a><a>&#160;12</a></desc></text>

(<a>Rev. 20:1-3;</a><a>&#160;Luke 8:30, 31;</a><a>&#160;1 John 3:8</a>) That action constitutes the initial stage of the bruising of the serpent’s head. What is “the abyss” into which Satan and the demons will be hurled? The Greek word <i>a′bys·sos</i> used by John means “very or exceedingly deep.” It is also translated “unfathomable, boundless,” and “the infinite void.” Thus, it is a place completely out of reach of anyone except Jehovah and his appointed angel “with the key of the abyss.” There, Satan will be in a state of deathlike inactivity so that “he might not mislead the nations anymore.” Truly, that “roaring lion” will be silenced!—<a>1 Pet. 5:8</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 9/15 1:15, 16</a></desc></text>

Hence, near the end of his life, Joshua could with heartfelt conviction say to his fellow Israelites the words of today’s text. Likewise today, Jehovah is proving true to his word. By means of his Son, he foretold that during the last days, the Kingdom message would be preached “in all the inhabited earth.” (<a>Matt. 24:14</a>) Who else but God Almighty could foretell such a work, see that it is done, and use many “unlettered and ordinary” people to accomplish it? (<a>Acts 4:13</a>) Hence, when we share in this work, we actually share in the fulfillment of Bible prophecy. We honor our Father and show that we really mean it when we pray: “Let your name be sanctified. Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.”—<a>Matt. 6:9, 10</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 3/15 5:7, 8</a></desc></text>

It was to reassure those who would become joint heirs with Christ, making up the secondary part of the promised “seed,” and to strengthen their faith. (<a>Gal. 3:29</a>) As the apostle Paul explained, Jehovah “stepped in with an oath, in order that, through two unchangeable things [his promise and his oath] in which it is impossible for God to lie, we . . . may have strong encouragement to lay hold on the hope set before us.” (<a>Heb. 6:13-18</a>) Anointed Christians are not the only ones who benefit from God’s sworn oath to Abraham. By means of Abraham’s “seed,” Jehovah swore that people of “all nations of the earth [would] bless themselves.” (<a>Gen. 22:18</a>) Such blessed ones include Christ’s obedient “other sheep,” who have set before them the hope of everlasting life on an earthly paradise.—<a>John 10:16</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 10/15 3:6-8</a></desc></text>

Jesus had to admonish his disciples to behave as lesser ones because some of them were influenced by the prevailing spirit of the day. “A reasoning entered among them as to who would be the greatest of them,” states <a>Luke 9:46</a>. Might we also begin to reason that we in some way are better than our fellow believers or are superior to people in general? Many in the world around us are motivated by pride and selfishness. Let us distance ourselves from the proud by acting humbly. When we do so and put Jehovah’s will to the fore, we become more refreshing associates. Jesus’ admonition to conduct ourselves as lesser ones truly is motivating. Should we not strive to manifest the spirit of a lesser one in all aspects of life? <a><i>w12</i> 11/15 3:11, 12</a></desc></text>

The fact was, though, that his course of wisdom in serving God disproved the claims that he was a wrongdoer. “Wisdom is proved righteous by its works,” Jesus said. That is so today too. As an example, some of their neighbors view as strange the brothers and sisters serving at the Bethel complex in Selters, Germany. But the mayor of the community spoke out in their behalf, reasoning: “The Witnesses who serve there have their own way of life, but one that in no way disturbs the lives of others in the community.” A similar conclusion was recently reached in connection with Jehovah’s Witnesses living in Moscow, Russia. They had been falsely accused of a number of wrong acts. Then in June 2010, the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, exonerated them. <a><i>w12</i> 12/15 3:13, 14</a></desc></text>

Have you ever wasted valuable energy and time on the wrong pursuits? Did you act in some way that resulted in harm to others? Many people worry about these things. To worry continually means to plague oneself, vex oneself, persecute oneself. It causes great anxiety. Does worrying solve any problems? Not one! Imagine trying to move forward by rocking for hours in a rocking chair, expending all that energy but getting nowhere! Instead of worrying, some positive action on your part may produce good results. You can apologize to the person you wronged, perhaps restoring good relations. You can avoid whatever led up to the wrong act, thereby preventing future problems. Then again, you may simply have to live through some situations of life. But worry is nothing but a form of paralysis that can leave one unable to serve God fully.

Used properly, such inventions can be useful tools. Used improperly, they can come between us and our heavenly Father. Consider computers. A computer can be an effective research and communication tool and at times a source of refreshing entertainment. We can, however, also become obsessed with computer technology. Marketers cleverly convince people that they <i>must have</i> the latest products. One young man so passionately desired a particular tablet computer that he secretly sold one of his kidneys to buy it. What a shortsighted sacrifice! It is even more tragic to sacrifice your intimacy with Jehovah through misuse or overuse of technology.

We realize that Jesus “came, not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his soul a ransom in exchange for many.” (<a>Mark 10:45</a>) How good it is to know about “the release by the ransom paid by Christ Jesus”! (<a>Rom. 3:22-24</a>) First-century Jews and Gentiles needed to repent of their sins and to exercise faith in Jesus’ ransom sacrifice. Otherwise, they could have no forgiveness. The situation is the same today. (<a>John 3:16,</a><a> 36</a>) If a person clings to false doctrines, such as the Trinity and the immortality of the soul, he cannot benefit from the ransom.

For example, a person could have a distorted sense of loyalty to his relatives. Of course, Christians want to have “natural affection” for relatives, not being like many who lack such affection in these “last days.” (<a>2 Tim. 3:1,</a><a> 3</a>) It is possible, though, to go to extremes in showing that affection. Many feel that “blood is thicker than water.” Thus, they might defend or side with relatives at all costs, taking it personally if a relative is offended. Think of what strong feelings of that kind led Dinah’s brothers to do. (<a>Gen. 34:13,</a><a>&#160;25-30</a>) And imagine what was in Absalom’s heart, leading him to murder his half brother Amnon.

(<a>Matt. 11:27</a>) In addition, Jesus gave his disciples “intellectual capacity that [they might] gain the knowledge of the true one,” Jehovah God. (<a>1 John 5:20</a>) What does that mean? Jesus opened up his followers’ minds so that they could understand his teachings about the Father. He did not hide his Father in a cloud of mystery by teaching that He was part of an incomprehensible Trinity. Did Jesus reveal everything that he knew about his Father? No, he wisely held back from sharing many things he knew. (<a>John 16:12</a>) Why? Because at the time, his disciples were “not able to bear” such knowledge.

While you are driving your automobile, for instance, suppose another car nearly collides with your vehicle. How will you react? You have read about episodes of road rage in which an individual became so angry that he attacked the other driver. As a Christian, however, you certainly would not want to do such a thing. How much better it would be to take a moment to analyze matters. Perhaps you were partly to blame for what took place because you were distracted in some way.

(<a>Matt. 24:37;</a><a>&#160;2 Pet. 2:5</a>) But they were “eating and drinking, men marrying and women being given in marriage, . . . and they took no note until the flood came and swept them all away.” Jesus therefore warned his followers: “Prove yourselves ready, because at an hour that you do not think to be it, the Son of man is coming.” (<a>Matt. 24:38, 39,</a><a> 44</a>) We must prove to be like Noah, not like the people of his day. <a><i>w12</i> 5/15 3:11, 12</a></desc></text>

They may feel beyond the reach of God’s mercy because they strayed off course either so far or so often. The fact is, though, that no matter what they may have done in the past, they can repent, change, and ask for forgiveness. (<a>Acts 3:19</a>) Jehovah’s mercy and loving-kindness can be extended to them, even as it has been to so many others. We all must follow the divine formula for acquiring peace of mind: “He that is covering over his transgressions will not succeed, but he that is confessing and leaving them will be shown mercy.” (<a>Prov. 28:13;</a><a>&#160;Jas. 5:14-16</a>) Thus, we can confess to God, pray for his forgiveness, and take steps to right the wrong. (<a>2 Cor. 7:10, 11</a>) If we have done these things, then we can enjoy the mercy of the One who ‘forgives in a large way.’—<a>Isa. 55:7</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 1/15 4:11</a></desc></text>

(<a>Dan. 7:7, 8,</a><a>&#160;23, 24</a>) The beast that Daniel saw represented the Roman World Power. In the fifth century C.E., the Roman Empire began to fragment. The ten horns sprouting from the head of that fearsome beast represent kingdoms that grew out of that empire. By the mid-18th century, Britain was on its way to become the dominant power on the world scene. Though Britain gained dominance, colonies in North America broke away. By the time the Lord’s day began in 1914, Britain had built the largest empire in history and the United States had become the greatest industrial power on earth. During World War I, the United States forged a special partnership with Britain.

(<a>Rom. 5:12</a>) If Satan could induce two perfect humans—not to mention a number of spirit creatures—to reject God’s sovereignty, he could deceive us too. His strategy remains much the same. He tries to mislead us into thinking that God’s standards are burdensome and rob us of fun and excitement. That thinking can exert a lot of power if we are repeatedly exposed to it. “Bad association greatly influenced me, especially because I was afraid of having a different opinion from my peers,” said a 24-year-old sister who had engaged in sexual immorality. <a><i>w12</i> 7/15 2:2, 3</a></desc></text>

Roman citizens in Philippi and throughout the Roman Empire were proud of their status and enjoyed special protection under Roman law. Members of the congregation in Philippi had greater reason for being proud.

(<a>2 Tim. 4:22;</a><a>&#160;Gal. 6:18;</a><a>&#160;Col. 3:9-12</a>) Today, we do well to ask ourselves: ‘What kind of spirit do I show? How can I more fully manifest a spirit that pleases God?

During the course of the evening meal, Jesus gets up and puts aside his outer garments. He girds himself with a towel. Then he puts water into a basin and begins to wash the feet of the disciples and to dry them off with the towel. He then puts on his outer garments. Why did Jesus perform this humble act? (<a>John 13:3-5</a>) Jesus himself explained: “Do you know what I have done to you? . . . If I, although Lord and Teacher, washed your feet, you also ought to wash the feet of one another.” (<a>John 13:12-14</a>) By displaying a willingness to perform such a lowly task, Jesus gave his apostles an object lesson that would be deeply engraved on their minds and would encourage them to be humble in the days ahead. <a><i>w12</i> 11/15 2:1, 2</a></desc></text>

Yet, Jesus indicated that his disciples would be humble servants, or slaves. There is nothing demeaning or oppressive, though, about this slavery involving true Christians. These slaves enjoy a position of honor, trust, and respect. Consider, for example, the comments Jesus made about one “slave” shortly before His death. Christ foretold that he would assign duties to a “faithful and discreet slave.” (<a>Matt. 24:45-47</a>) It is significant that in a parallel account, that slave is called a “steward.” (<a>Luke 12:42-44</a>) Most faithful Christians now alive are not among those who make up that “faithful steward.” However, the Scriptures show that all who serve God have a stewardship. <a><i>w12</i> 12/15 2:1-3</a></desc></text>

King Nebuchadnezzar assembled Babylon’s dignitaries and demanded that they worship a towering image of gold. Any who would not do so were to die in a fiery furnace. The three Hebrews respectfully told Nebuchadnezzar: “Our God whom we are serving is able to rescue us. Out of the burning fiery furnace and out of your hand, O king, he will rescue us. But if not, let it become known to you, O king, that your gods are not the ones we are serving, and the image of gold that you have set up we will not worship.” (<a>Dan. 3:16-18</a>) The thrilling rescue of the three Hebrews is vividly described at <a>Daniel 3:19-30</a>.

One sister said: “Speculations were made as to what JW stood for—Just Wait, Just Watch, and the correct one.” We had been called Bible Students, but we adopted the name Jehovah’s Witnesses by resolution on Sunday, July 26, 1931. It was a thrill to receive that Scriptural name. “I will never forget the tremendous shout and applause that vibrated through that meeting place,” recalled one brother.

For instance, notice the wording of <a>Proverbs 24:16</a>: “The righteous one may fall even seven times, and he will certainly get up; but the wicked ones will be made to stumble by calamity.” Jehovah will not allow those trusting in him to stumble or to experience a fall—an adversity or a setback in their worship—from which they <i>cannot</i> recover. We are assured that Jehovah will help us “get up” so that we can continue giving him our utmost devotion. How comforting that is for all who love Jehovah deeply from the heart!

Of course, we must never overestimate our own strength. Instead, we should humbly recognize that we need God’s power in order to resist pressure. We need to pray for Jehovah’s spirit and must let love for him motivate us to uphold his name and standards. Moreover, we need to prepare for pressure before we face a test.

In other words, he might be thinking, ‘I will wait and see if Jehovah really is true to his word.’ He might then try to make a name for himself in this world, to seek financial security instead of putting God’s Kingdom first, or to trust in higher education to secure a comfortable life now. Really, though, would that not be evidence of a lack of faith?

Naturally, willingness to forgive others does not mean that you have to approve of their wrong behavior or minimize the damage it does.

Israel, on the other hand, quickly forgot their dedication to God and “pained even the Holy One of Israel.” (<a>Ps. 78:41</a>) For example, while Moses was busy receiving further instructions on Mount Sinai, the Israelites became impatient and began to lose faith in God, thinking that Moses had deserted them. So they made a golden image of a calf and said to the people: “This is your God, O Israel, who led you up out of the land of Egypt.” (<a>Ex. 32:1,</a><a> 4</a>) Then they held what they called “a festival to Jehovah” and bowed down and sacrificed to their man-made image.

But what of Ezekiel, Daniel and his three companions already in Babylon, and some Jews soon to be taken there? They were like good figs. A remnant of them would return to rebuild Jerusalem. In time, that did occur. (<a>Jer. 24:8-10;</a><a>&#160;25:11, 12;</a><a>&#160;29:10</a>) Jehovah said of those represented by the good figs: “I will give them a heart to know me, that I am Jehovah; and they must become my people.” (<a>Jer. 24:7</a>) How encouraging that is!

We may share with them what we know about God’s name, his purpose for humans, and his personality as revealed in the Bible. Moreover, we may discuss with fellow believers some Bible accounts that reveal God’s personality in a way that we did not appreciate before. That way, they too may benefit. How about revealing the Father by your conduct as you strive to imitate Jesus? When people see in our actions the love of Christ, they will be drawn to the Father as well as to Jesus.

(<a>Luke 23:31</a>) How did this affect their attitude toward the divine name? History indicates that, in time, the Jews developed a superstitious attitude toward God’s name, viewing it as something that they should not pronounce. (<a>Ex. 20:7</a>) God’s name gradually became disassociated from Judaism. It no doubt hurt Jehovah to see his name treated so disrespectfully. (<a>Ps. 78:40, 41</a>) However, God, “whose name is Jealous,” clearly would not forever attach it to a people who had disowned him and whom he had disowned.

Would it not be easier for the wife to respect her husband when she sees that he manifests humility and gives sincere consideration to her likes and dislikes rather than being concerned only about his own preferences?

We “speak” the pure language when our conduct is in accord with God’s laws and principles. Citizens of God’s Kingdom may learn basic Bible teachings quickly and get baptized.

Jewish exiles in Babylon did not have the Holy Scriptures in complete form, but they did have knowledge of the Mosaic Law, with its Ten Commandments.

Rather, Jehovah was speaking of the figurative heart. That “heart” refers to a person’s entire inner self, encompassing his desires, thoughts, disposition, attitudes, and goals.

Joseph and Mary, for example, would travel about 60 miles (100 km) one way from Nazareth to Jerusalem.

It is everywhere. It is often manifested in the no-one-is-going-to-tell-me-what-to-do or the fight-for-your-rights attitude of so many people today.

It is vital to weigh prayerfully any thought of divorce when neither mate has been guilty of sexual immorality. <a><i>w12</i> 5/15 2:5, 6</a></desc></text>

If you do not feel motivated to expand your ministry, ask Jehovah to give you both the desire and the ability to do so. (<a>2 Pet. 3:9,</a><a> 11</a>) Noah, Moses, Jeremiah, Paul, and Jesus were all devoted men. They used their time and energy to proclaim Jehovah’s warning message. They did not allow themselves to be distracted. The end of the present system of things is imminent; hence, all of us who have dedicated our lives to God need to be sure that we are continuing to do our utmost in following these excellent Scriptural examples.

Patience helps us to endure until we gain salvation, no matter how much time remains in this system. Jehovah is now giving us the opportunity to prove our complete trust in his decisions and—if necessary—to be willing to suffer evil for the sake of his name. (<a>1 Pet. 4:13, 14</a>) God is also giving us training that can help us to have the patience needed for salvation. Jesus has all authority in heaven and on earth, and nothing can snatch you away from his protective care—except you. (<a>John 10:28, 29</a>) There is no need to fear the future or even death. Those who patiently endure to the end will be saved. So we must make sure that we do not allow the world to seduce us and make us stop relying on Jehovah.

The apostle Paul wrote: “‘If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by doing this you will heap fiery coals upon his head.’ Do not let yourself be conquered by the evil, but keep conquering the evil with the good.” (<a>Rom. 12:20, 21</a>) By your graciousness in the face of provocation, you may soften even the hardest of attitudes and bring out the good in people.

The radiant splendor of creation? (<a>Ps. 19:1</a>) The praise and glory given to humans having exceptional wealth, wisdom, or accomplishments? In the Scriptures, the original-language words for “glory” convey the sense of heaviness. In ancient times—when money was made of precious metals—the heavier the coin, the greater its value. Words used to express the idea of weightiness came to be understood figuratively to mean that which is treasured, magnificent, or impressive. While we may be impressed with the power, position, or reputation of another person, what does God look for in humans? The Scriptures actually speak of a glory that God confers on humans. For example, <a>Proverbs 22:4</a> states: “The result of humility and the fear of Jehovah is riches and glory and life.” And the disciple James wrote: “Humble yourselves in the eyes of Jehovah, and he will exalt you.”—<a>Jas. 4:10</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 2/15 4:1, 2</a></desc></text>

Therefore, if you have recently come to know God and got baptized, what now? Continue to get to know Jehovah better, growing to spiritual maturity. And if you have been baptized for many years, what now? You too must continue to deepen and broaden your knowledge of Jehovah. May we never become complacent in our relationship with him.

Of course, he may realize that we will not simply abandon Jehovah abruptly. Therefore, he slyly employs “this system of things” in an effort to weaken our heartfelt zeal for God gradually. (<a>Mark 4:18, 19</a>) Why is that method of Satan so effective? Because by his weakening our zeal ever so gradually, we are not aware of it. Yes, the influences of Satan’s world may cause our zeal to diminish little by little. If that happens, Satan has succeeded in reducing our heartfelt zeal for Jehovah’s service to something less.

What does that word bring to your mind? Warmth? Happiness? Working together toward a common goal? A safe haven in which to grow, learn, and share ideas? Likely it does if you are part of a caring family. Jehovah himself is the Originator of the family. He purposed that all his creatures in heaven and on earth enjoy a sense of security, mutual trust, and genuine unity. After they sinned, humans were no longer part of God’s universal family, but Jehovah’s purpose was not thwarted. He will make sure that the Paradise earth will be fully inhabited with the offspring of Adam and Eve. (<a>Gen. 1:28;</a><a>&#160;Isa. 45:18</a>) He has made every preparation to fulfill this purpose.

Under Kingdom rule, the desire of every resident to have his own home will be fulfilled, for it was prophesied through Isaiah: “They will certainly build houses and have occupancy; and they will certainly plant vineyards and eat their fruitage.” (<a>Isa. 65:21</a>) Yet, having a home of their own is not the only prospect. After all, some today live in their own home, a few even in a mansion or on a grand estate.

First, he swore to David that his throne would last forever. (<a>Ps. 89:35, 36;</a><a>&#160;132:11, 12</a>) Second, Jehovah inspired David to foretell that, in time, a unique King would also serve as mankind’s High Priest. In Israel the kingship and priesthood were completely separate. The priests were from the tribe of Levi, and the kings were from the tribe of Judah. But concerning his illustrious future heir, David foretold that he would be both a king and a priest. In fulfillment of that prophecy, Jesus Christ, the promised Seed, now rules from heaven.

Whereas pride fosters division and contention, forgiveness promotes peace within the congregation. We may need to ‘humble ourselves’ by sincerely apologizing to another person if we are unable to honor an agreement because of circumstances beyond our control. Although he may be able to assign a measure of blame to the other party, the humble Christian concerns himself with his own failings and is willing to admit them.

They are happy to be serving Jehovah as part of a worldwide association of brothers and sisters who have the same desire. Therefore, it is only natural for them to “have love for the whole association of brothers.” Such brotherly love, which is so rare in today’s selfish society, comes at times as a surprise to non-Witnesses. For example, a tour guide working with an American travel agency was amazed at the affection and assistance shown by the Witnesses to foreign delegates at an international convention in Germany in 2009.

He apparently suffered ill effects mentally and physically and lost joy because of his failure to confess. What brought David pardon and relief? Only a confession to God. Jehovah answered David’s prayers and strengthened him to go ahead with his life and accomplish something worthwhile. Similarly, if you pray sincerely from the heart, you can be confident that Jehovah will give his keen attention to your supplication.

In each case, their deplorable actions wreaked havoc on others! But why should this be of concern to us? A modern-day author lists betrayal among today’s most common vices. That is to be expected. When giving the sign of “the conclusion of the system of things,” Jesus said: “Many . . . will betray one another.” (<a>Matt. 24:3,</a><a> 10</a>) “To betray” means “to give up to, or place in the power of an enemy, by treachery or disloyalty.” Such a lack of loyalty confirms that we are living in “the last days” when, Paul foretold, people would be “disloyal, . . . betrayers.” (<a>2 Tim. 3:1, 2,</a><a> 4</a>) Disloyalty and betrayal cause pain and suffering.

For example, consider Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. These patriarchs and their families must have had discussions about how to please Jehovah. So it is not surprising that upright Joseph rejected sexual immorality so as not to “sin against God.” (<a>Gen. 39:7-9</a>) Christian traditions were also handed down orally or by example. Among these were points regarding the Lord’s Evening Meal that the apostle Paul passed on to Christian congregations. (<a>1 Cor. 11:2,</a><a> 23</a>) Today, details needed for us to worship God “with spirit and truth” are part of his written Word.

For example, he publicly denied his Master, not just once, but three times. (<a>Luke 22:54-60</a>) Later, Peter failed to act in a Christian manner, treating Gentile believers as if they were somehow not as good as circumcised Jewish Christians. The apostle Paul, however, saw the matter clearly—there was no room for class distinctions in the congregation. Peter’s attitude was wrong. Before Peter’s conduct could sour the brotherhood, Paul acted by counseling Peter directly, face-to-face. (<a>Gal. 2:11-14</a>) Was Peter’s pride so wounded that he quit the race for life?

When we are “broken at heart” or “crushed in spirit,” he draws near to us. This in itself may give us a measure of comfort, as it did David, who sang: “I will be joyful and rejoice in your loving-kindness, in that you have seen my affliction; you have known about the distresses of my soul.” (<a>Ps. 31:7</a>) But Jehovah does more than just notice our distress.

He was pleased to have Jehovah, the Supreme Judge of the universe, handle matters in His own way and time. The things Jesus learned during his prehuman existence undoubtedly included the prophecies foretelling details of his life on earth as the Messiah. Hence, he likely knew in advance that unpleasant experiences awaited him. Yet, Jesus accepted the assignment to live on earth and die as the promised Messiah. Why? Highlighting the humility of God’s only-begotten Son, the apostle Paul wrote: “Although he was existing in God’s form, [he] gave no consideration to a seizure, namely, that he should be equal to God.

Recall that when Noah and his family emerged from the ark after the Flood, Jehovah told them: “A fear of you and a terror of you will continue upon every living creature of the earth.” That was for the animals’ self-preservation.

The Bible contains numerous examples of people who faced a similar situation. For example, Cain had to decide whether to act on his anger or to control it. (<a>Gen. 4:6, 7</a>) Joshua had to choose between serving the true God or worshipping false gods. Joshua’s goal was to stay close to Jehovah; hence, he chose a path that took him in that direction. Cain had no such goal, and he chose the path that took him farther away from Jehovah. At times, we may face a fork-in-the-road decision.

This is the hereditary possession [or, “heritage,” <i>By</i>] of the servants of Jehovah, and their righteousness is from me,’ is the utterance of Jehovah.” (<a>Isa. 54:17</a>) Nothing in Satan’s arsenal of weapons can do us permanent harm.

(<a>Jer. 5:23, 24;</a><a>&#160;7:24-26</a>) God told them: “Get yourselves circumcised to Jehovah, and take away the foreskins of your hearts.” (<a>Jer. 4:4;</a><a>&#160;18:11, 12</a>) Hence, Jews in Jeremiah’s day needed figurative heart surgery—‘circumcision of the heart’—even as those in Moses’ time did. (<a>Deut. 10:16;</a><a>&#160;30:6</a>) To ‘take away the foreskin of their heart’ meant getting rid of what made their heart unresponsive—their thinking, affections, or motives that were in conflict with God’s.—<a>Acts 7:51</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 3/15 2:7-9</a></desc></text>

Prayer is vital. Paul encouraged fellow believers to “stand firm against the machinations of the Devil.” Then he urged them: “With every form of prayer and supplication . . . , carry on prayer on every occasion.” (<a>Eph. 6:11,</a><a>&#160;18;</a><a>&#160;1 Pet. 4:7</a>) How will such prayers affect us? Paul stated: “In everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to God; and the peace of God that excels all thought will <i>guard your hearts.”</i> (<a>Phil. 4:6, 7</a>) Yes, we have to pray fervently and frequently in order to maintain a complete heart toward Jehovah. (<a>Luke 6:12</a>) Hence, ask yourself, ‘How earnest and frequent are my prayers?’ (<a>Matt. 7:7;</a><a>&#160;Rom. 12:12</a>) Your answer reveals much about the depth of your heartfelt desire to serve God. <a><i>w12</i> 4/15 3:16,</a><a>&#160;18</a></desc></text>

God’s enemies—Satan and those under his influence—are trying to stop the work that Jesus assigned to His followers, including us. (<a>Matt. 28:19, 20</a>) Despite the Devil’s attacks, we know Jehovah as “a living God, who is a Savior of all sorts of men, especially of faithful ones.” He “knows how to deliver people of godly devotion out of trial.” (<a>1 Tim. 4:10;</a><a>&#160;2 Pet. 2:9</a>) Soon, Jehovah will bring an end to this wicked system of things. While we have not been given all the details and the exact time when this will occur, we do know that at just the right time, Christ will do away with God’s enemies, and Jehovah’s sovereignty will be vindicated. May we never fall into the snare of thinking that “all things are continuing exactly as from creation’s beginning.”—<a>2 Pet. 3:3, 4;</a><a>&#160;1 Thess. 5:1</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 5/15 3:17, 18</a></desc></text>

They have all the fun!’ Will you see through such contemptible lies and remain loyal to God? Will you recognize that only Jehovah’s “perfect law,” the law of the Christ, can lead you to true freedom? (<a>Jas. 1:25</a>) If so, cherish that law, and never be tempted to misuse your Christian freedom. (<a>1 Pet. 2:16</a>) How sad that many young ones in the truth—and even a number of older ones—have had to learn the hard way that sinful pleasures often come at great cost! (<a>Gal. 6:7, 8</a>) So ask yourself: ‘Do I recognize Satan’s schemes for what they really are—cruel deceptions? Do I view Jehovah as my closest Friend, the one who always tells the truth and wants what is best for me?’—<a>Isa. 48:17, 18</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 7/15 2:6, 7,</a><a>&#160;9</a></desc></text>

The clay, therefore, represents elements within the sphere of influence of the Anglo-American World Power, elements that make it weaker than the solid iron of the Roman Empire. The clay is referred to as “the offspring of mankind,” or the common people. (<a>Dan. 2:43</a>) In the Anglo-American World Power, people have risen up to claim their rights through civil rights campaigns, labor unions, and independence movements. The common people undermine the ability of the Anglo-American World Power to act with ironlike strength. Also, opposing ideologies and close election results that do not end up in a clear majority have weakened the power base of even popular leaders, so that they have no clear mandate to implement their policies.—<a>2 Tim. 3:1-3</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 6/15 2:9</a></desc></text>

(<a>Mark 12:29</a>) The Trinity doctrine runs counter to the commission Jesus gave his followers to “make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit.” (<a>Matt. 28:19</a>) To be baptized as a genuine Christian and one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, a person must acknowledge the supremacy of the Father, Jehovah, as well as the position and authority of God’s Son, Jesus. The baptism candidate must also believe that the holy spirit is God’s active force, not part of a Trinity. (<a>Gen. 1:2</a>) An individual who continues to believe in the Trinity cannot be baptized in symbol of a valid dedication to Jehovah God.

By means of his sacrifice, Jesus had opened the way for those exercising faith in him to come to know God in a most extraordinary way—they could become sons of God! To remain in that most blessed relationship, the Galatians would have to reject the teachings of Judaizers, who were insisting that they observe the Mosaic Law. Why, uncircumcised Gentiles in the congregations had never even been under the Law! Jews and Gentiles alike needed to make spiritual progress. This involved recognizing that they could not establish their righteousness through the Mosaic Law arrangement. The apostle Paul’s counsel to the Galatians was recorded for a purpose: to prevent true Christians in any period from turning their backs on the riches of Bible truth and returning to the things behind. <a><i>w13</i> 3/15 3:3, 4</a></desc></text>

Likewise, those desiring to be Kingdom citizens do well to learn all they can about God’s Kingdom. Human governments also require that their subjects learn and obey the laws of the land. It seems only reasonable, then, that Jehovah should expect us to learn and obey the laws and principles that govern all Kingdom citizens. (<a>John 15:10;</a><a>&#160;1 John 5:3</a>) Human laws are often flawed and may be unfair. In contrast, “the law of Jehovah is perfect.” (<a>Ps. 19:7</a>) Do we delight in God’s law and read his Word each day? (<a>Ps. 1:1, 2</a>) The only way we can learn God’s law is to study it for ourselves. Nobody else can do this for us. <a><i>w12</i> 8/15 2:5, 6</a></desc></text>

Older men in the congregation are not perfect, just as they were not perfect in the time of the apostles. Elders may make mistakes that affect us personally. If that happens, how inappropriate it would be for any member of the congregation to react according to the world’s spirit, vehemently demanding “justice” or that “something be done about this brother”! Jehovah may choose to overlook certain minor failings. Can we not do the same? Because of what they perceive as defects in the elders, some individuals who engage in serious wrongdoing in the congregation have refused to appear before a committee of elders assigned to help them. This could be likened to a patient who loses out on the benefits of a treatment because he does not like something about the doctor. <a><i>w12</i> 10/15 2:6, 7</a></desc></text>

A few minutes before leaving to pick him up for the meeting, however, you realize that there is not enough fuel in your vehicle to make the trip. You need to rush off to purchase some. As you do, the official arrives. He looks around but cannot find you. He cannot wait, so he asks someone else to drive him. You soon get back and realize that the official has left without you. How would you feel? In his parable of the virgins, Jesus used a similar situation to illustrate why during the time of the end, some anointed Christians would prove to be faithful and discreet, but others would not. (<a>Matt. 25:1-12</a>) He emphasized his point by saying: “Keep on the watch, therefore, because you know neither the day nor the hour”—that is, when Jesus would actually execute God’s judgment on Satan’s world. <a><i>w12</i> 9/15 4:1,</a><a>&#160;3</a></desc></text>

But they are still righteous in Jehovah’s eyes if they continue to “get up,” that is, sincerely repent and strive to resume a course of loyal service. We can see that from the way God dealt with ancient Israel. (<a>Isa. 41:9, 10</a>) <a>Proverbs 24:16</a> focuses on the positive, our ‘getting up’ with the help of our merciful God. (<a>Isa. 55:7</a>) Expressing their confidence in us, Jehovah God and Jesus Christ kindly encourage us to “get up.” (<a>Ps. 86:5;</a><a>&#160;John 5:19</a>) Even if a runner stumbles or falls in a marathon, he may have time to recover and finish the course if he acts with urgency. In our race for everlasting life, we do not know the “day and hour” when the end of the race will come. (<a>Matt. 24:36</a>) Still, the less we stumble, the more likely we are to keep a steady pace, stay in the race, and finish it successfully. <a><i>w13</i> 3/15 1:7, 8</a></desc></text>

It is “the Lord’s day,” which began when “the kingdom of the world” became “the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ.” (<a>Rev. 1:10;</a><a>&#160;11:15</a>) That day started in 1914 with the birth of the Messianic Kingdom in the heavens. Decades before 1914, Jehovah’s worshippers declared to the nations that the end of “the appointed times of the nations” would come in that year and that the world would enter into an unequaled period of trouble. (<a>Luke 21:24</a>) How did the nations respond? Instead of paying heed to that timely warning, political and religious leaders scorned and persecuted those zealous anointed evangelizers. In doing so, these world leaders mocked Almighty God himself, for anointed Kingdom ambassadors represent “heavenly Jerusalem”—the Messianic Kingdom—of which they are a part.—<a>Heb. 12:22,</a><a> 28</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 2/15 3:4</a></desc></text>

If not, you are in good company! Throughout the ages, all who have truly loved Jehovah have felt like strangers, or aliens, in this system of things. For example, while moving from encampment to encampment in the land of Canaan, faithful worshippers of God “publicly declared that they were strangers and temporary residents.” (<a>Heb. 11:13</a>) Likewise, Christ’s anointed followers, whose “citizenship exists in the heavens,” view themselves as “aliens and temporary residents” in the present system of things. (<a>Phil. 3:20;</a><a>&#160;1 Pet. 2:11</a>) Christ’s “other sheep” are also “no part of the world, just as [Jesus was] no part of the world.” (<a>John 10:16;</a><a>&#160;17:16</a>) Nevertheless, God’s people are not without a “home.” In fact, we enjoy the protection of the most secure and loving home imaginable, one that is discerned through eyes of faith. <a><i>w13</i> 3/15 4:1, 2</a></desc></text>

Two of these involved a married couple, Uriah and Bath-sheba. The king’s sin of adultery with Bath-sheba was compounded by his having innocent Uriah killed. The consequences of those sins were painful for all involved. Nevertheless, the way that God corrected David reveals a great deal about Jehovah’s forgiveness. He sent his prophet Nathan to David. Being a God of forgiveness, Jehovah was apparently interested in finding a basis for extending mercy. Do you not find this approach on Jehovah’s part heartwarming? He did not force David to confess but simply had Nathan present the king with a story that illustrated the badness of his sins. (<a>2 Sam. 12:1-4</a>) How effective that way of handling matters proved to be! David realized the gravity of what he had done and contritely admitted: “I have sinned against Jehovah.”—<a>2 Sam. 12:5-14</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 11/15 4:3,</a><a>&#160;5-7</a></desc></text>

(<a>Heb. 13:17</a>) What, though, of the many loyal Christians who are not overseers? The apostle Peter wrote a letter to Christians in general, stating: “In proportion as each one has received a gift, use it in ministering to one another as fine stewards of God’s undeserved kindness expressed in various ways.” (<a>1 Pet. 1:1;</a><a>&#160;4:10</a>) God has in his undeserved kindness imparted to all of us gifts, assets, abilities, or talents that we can use to benefit fellow believers.

But we need not try too hard to erase all signs of aging. Those signs can be evidence of maturity, dignity, and inner beauty. For example, note the words of today’s text. That is how Jehovah views us, and we should try to view ourselves as he does. (<a>1 Pet. 3:3, 4</a>) Is it wise, therefore, to risk unnecessary and potentially dangerous surgical procedures or medical treatments merely to make oneself more physically attractive? “The joy of Jehovah” is a source of true beauty that radiates from the inside, regardless of age or health. (<a>Neh. 8:10</a>) Only in the new world will we be completely healthy and regain youthful beauty. (<a>Job 33:25;</a><a>&#160;Isa. 33:24</a>) Until then, showing practical wisdom and faith will help us to stay close to Jehovah while we make the best of our present circumstances.—<a>1 Tim. 4:8</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 1/15 3:10</a></desc></text>

Inflamed with ambition, he was determined to usurp the throne of his father, King David. Absalom first ‘stole the hearts of the men of Israel’ by ingratiating himself with them, using sly promises and insincere expressions of affection. He would embrace and kiss them, as if he were truly interested in them and their needs. (<a>2 Sam. 15:2-6</a>) Absalom even won over David’s trusted confidant Ahithophel, who turned traitor and joined the coup. In <a>Psalms 3 and</a><a>&#160;55</a>, David describes how such disloyalty affected him. (<a>Ps. 3:1-8;</a><a>&#160;55:12-14</a>) Absalom exposed his shameless disregard for God’s sovereignty by his ambitious scheming and blatant conspiracy against Jehovah’s appointed king.

The apostle Paul raised this serious question: “If indeed any man does not know how to preside over his own household, how will he take care of God’s congregation?” (<a>1 Tim. 3:5</a>) In fact, when both mates profess to be Christians and yet their marriage fails, observers may think that such individuals do not really practice what they preach. (<a>Rom. 2:22-24</a>) When baptized marriage mates are planning to separate or to divorce each other on unscriptural grounds, something surely is spiritually wrong in their life. Scriptural principles are apparently not being applied by one partner or perhaps by both partners. If they were truly ‘trusting in Jehovah with all their heart,’ there would be little reason for believing that they could not avoid a failed marriage.—<a>Prov. 3:5, 6</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 5/15 2:7, 8</a></desc></text>

How would we know the answers to these and other important questions if we did not have the inspired Word of God? How, though, was God’s message transmitted by holy spirit to Bible writers? Did they receive precise wording or just ideas that they could express in their own words? Consider how a businessman might compose a letter. When precise wording is important, he writes the letter himself or dictates it to his secretary word for word. The secretary types it, and the letter bears the businessman’s signature. At other times, he provides only the principal ideas, and the secretary prepares the letter, using her own style or vocabulary. The businessman may then proofread it.

The first stage prepares the congregation of anointed ones for life in heaven under Jesus Christ as their spiritual Head. This stage began at Pentecost 33 C.E. when Jehovah started to gather those who would rule with Christ in heaven.

(<a>Jas. 1:5</a>) We need to act in harmony with our prayers by engaging in regular personal study and by applying God’s Word. The Bible study aids provided by the faithful and discreet slave shed light on the traps set by the Devil and help us to avoid them. Prayer and Bible study promote in us a love for what is good. But it is equally important that we develop a hatred for what is bad. (<a>Ps. 97:10</a>) Meditating on the consequences of pursuing selfish desires can help us to avoid them. (<a>Jas. 1:14, 15</a>) When we learn to hate what is bad and truly love what is good, the bait that Satan places in his traps repels us; it holds no allure.

No. (<a>Matt. 7:1, 2</a>) But you can be confident that justice lies in God’s hands.

He or she also suffers the effects of inherited imperfection. (<a>Rom. 3:23</a>) Jehovah feels compassion toward all imperfect mankind. Therefore, it is appropriate to pray for the offender. It is unlikely that we would continue being angry with someone for whom we are praying. And that we should avoid harboring resentment toward even those who mistreat us is clear from Jesus’ words: “Continue to love your enemies and to pray for those persecuting you.”—<a>Matt. 5:44</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 11/15 5:14, 15</a></desc></text>

In Bible times, conventioners had to make sacrifices to attend. So do many today. Yet, the benefits are well worth the effort. These events were—and still are—important spiritual occasions. They provide us with information and understanding that are critical to our maintaining a close relationship with God. Conventions motivate us to apply what we learn, help us to avoid problems, and encourage us to stay focused on pursuits and interests that will refresh us rather than weigh us down. (<a>Ps. 122:2-4</a>) However, certain things have changed in the way conventions are organized. Some conventions had lasted eight days! There were morning, afternoon, and evening sessions. Field service was a regular part of the program. Volunteers worked long and hard to prepare breakfast, lunch, and supper for attendees. <a><i>w12</i> 9/15 5:15,</a><a>&#160;17</a></desc></text>
<text date='15-11-2014'><date>Saturday, November 15</date><script><i>Do not swear at all.—</i><a><i>Matt. 5:34</i></a><i>.</i></script><desc>Jesus said this in condemnation of the casual habit that many people have in their daily conversation of repeatedly swearing to this or to that, without ever intending to do what they say. Do Jesus’ words mean that all making of oaths is bad? How could that be? Jehovah God and his righteous servant Abraham made sworn oaths on important occasions. Also, God’s Law required the taking of a sworn oath to settle certain disputes. (<a>Ex. 22:10, 11;</a><a>&#160;Num. 5:21, 22</a>) Thus, it may be necessary for a Christian to swear to tell the truth when testifying in a court of law. Or, on a rare occasion, a Christian might find it necessary to make a sworn oath to assure others of his intentions or to help settle a matter. In fact, when Jesus himself was put under oath by the high priest, he did not object to it but responded truthfully to the Jewish Sanhedrin.—<a>Matt. 26:63, 64</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 10/15 4:1, 2</a></desc></text>

Perhaps you gave up a promising career or a successful business to have more time for Kingdom pursuits. Or perhaps you remained unmarried or if married, decided to forgo having children to make yourself available for service that otherwise would not have been possible for you. You made those decisions on the basis of your deep love for Jehovah and an earnest desire to help others who wanted to serve him. You need not think that you would have been better off had you lived your life differently. You can have the deep satisfaction of knowing that you did what you knew to be right in your case and that you did your best to serve Jehovah. He will not forget your life of self-sacrifice. In the real life yet to come, he will reward you with blessings far better than any you can now imagine!—<a>1 Tim. 6:19</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 1/15 4:15, 16</a></desc></text>

It was part of the religion of the ancients, and was the very root of all mythology.” The article added that the unscriptural idea of the dead communicating with the living “has given cover and force to the deceptions practised by ‘demons’ under the guise of dis-embodied spirits of men. They have eagerly availed themselves of this mode of concealing their identity, and have thus perpetuated their sway over the minds and lives of many.” The early booklet <i>What Say the Scriptures About Spiritism?</i> gave similar warnings, as have our more recent publications. <a><i>w13</i> 2/15 2:11</a></desc></text>

And him that calls down evil upon you I shall curse.” (<a>Gen. 12:2, 3</a>) With those words, Jehovah took it upon himself to become a secure dwelling for Abraham and for his descendants. (<a>Gen. 26:1-6</a>) Jehovah fulfilled his promise. For example, he prevented Pharaoh of Egypt and King Abimelech of Gerar from violating Sarah and doing away with Abraham. He protected Isaac and Rebekah in a similar manner. (<a>Gen. 12:14-20;</a><a>&#160;20:1-14;</a><a>&#160;26:6-11</a>) We read: “[Jehovah] did not allow any human to defraud them, but on their account he reproved kings, saying: ‘Do not you men touch my anointed ones, and to my prophets do nothing bad.’”—<a>Ps. 105:14, 15</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 3/15 4:4, 5</a></desc></text>

(<a>1 Sam. 1:4-8</a>) We need to be faithful in attending meetings. As we all have experienced, meetings provide vital encouragement. (<a>Heb. 10:24, 25</a>) The warmth of Christian fellowship comforts us. A simple expression made in a talk or comment may touch our heart. In conversation before or after a meeting, a fellow believer may give us a listening ear or share consoling words. (<a>Prov. 15:23;</a><a>&#160;17:17</a>) As we raise our voices in song to Jehovah, our spirits are uplifted. Especially when we are beset by “disquieting thoughts” do we need the encouragement that we receive at meetings, where Jehovah sustains us with his “own consolations” and supports us in our determination to remain faithful.

Therefore, it is not surprising to hear someone say to a boy, ‘You are just like your father.’ A girl may be told, ‘You remind me of your mother.’ And children often imitate what they see in their parents. But what about us? Can we imitate our heavenly Father, Jehovah? Although we have not seen him, we can perceive his precious qualities by studying his Word, by observing his creation, and by meditating on the Scriptures and especially on the words and deeds of God’s Son, Jesus Christ. (<a>John 1:18;</a><a>&#160;Rom. 1:20</a>) In practicing godly devotion, we should display the qualities of the One who made us. Anointed ones and their earthly companions reflect Jehovah’s glory in their life and ministry.

With personal experience as our teacher, could we ever have the same sentiments as the psalmist had toward “the law of Jehovah”? The sad reality, though, is that some have allowed the love they first had for Bible truth to cool off. (<a>Rev. 2:4</a>) They no longer walk in the way that pleases Jehovah. (<a>Isa. 30:21</a>) That does not have to happen to us. We can and should work at maintaining our appreciation for the Bible and its teachings. The Bible is an important gift from our loving Creator. (<a>Jas. 1:17</a>) What will help us deepen our appreciation for “the word of God”? A key is reflecting on how Bible writers were guided to write the Scriptures. That involves calling to mind some of the abundant evidence of its inspiration. Doing so should stimulate us to read from God’s Word daily and to apply its counsel.—<a>Heb. 4:12</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 6/15 4:1, 2</a></desc></text>

In fact, not knowing dignifies us, allowing us to use our free will in manifesting our loyalty to Jehovah. Although we look forward to surviving the end of this system, we serve Jehovah because we love him, not merely to get life. (<a>Ps. 37:4</a>) We find pleasure in doing his will, and we realize that God is teaching us to benefit ourselves. (<a>Isa. 48:17</a>) Another benefit of our not knowing the day or the hour is that we thus have the opportunity to make Jehovah’s heart glad. When we serve him out of love—not because of a date or solely because of a reward—we contribute to Jehovah’s answer to the baseless taunts of his adversary, Satan. (<a>Job 2:4, 5;</a><a>&#160;Prov. 27:11</a>) Considering all the pain and sorrow that the Devil has caused, we gladly stand up for Jehovah’s sovereignty and reject Satan’s wicked rule. <a><i>w12</i> 9/15 4:5, 6</a></desc></text>

One young brother was tactfully counseled by the elders about playing violent video games. Sadly, he did not receive the counsel well and had to be deleted as a ministerial servant because he no longer met the Scriptural qualifications. (<a>Ps. 11:5;</a><a>&#160;1 Tim. 3:8-10</a>) Afterward, the brother made it widely known that he did not agree, repeatedly writing letters critical of the elders to the branch office and even influencing others in the congregation to do the same. It is really counterproductive, though, for us to jeopardize the peace of the entire congregation in an attempt to justify our actions. How much better to view reproof as a way to open our eyes to see weaknesses that we were not aware of and then quietly accept the correction.—<a>Lam. 3:28, 29</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 10/15 2:8, 9</a></desc></text>

The Scriptures indicate that a willingness to forgive others regardless of how often they offend us is a Christian requirement. Jesus used an illustration about a slave who was forgiven a large debt by his master. When this slave would not likewise show mercy to a fellow slave who owed him a small amount, his master had him thrown into prison. (<a>Matt. 18:21-34</a>) Jesus’ conclusion was: “In like manner my heavenly Father will also deal with you if you do not forgive each one his brother from your hearts.” (<a>Matt. 18:35</a>) Hence, anyone who desires Jehovah’s friendship is obliged to forgive the shortcomings of his fellow human. <a><i>w12</i> 11/15 5:3-5</a></desc></text>

If you live in a land where work is scarce, you might be tempted to accept the first job offer—<i>any</i> offer—that comes along. What, though, if the nature of the work conflicts with Bible principles? What if the schedule or traveling involved will impede your Christian activity or take you away from your family? Should you accept the offer anyway, thinking that an unsuitable job is better than no job? Remember, choosing the wrong path could distance you from Jehovah. (<a>Heb. 2:1</a>) Keep in mind your destination. Ask yourself, ‘Where do I want a job or career to take me?’ If you view secular work as a means to an end—to support yourself and your family in Jehovah’s service—Jehovah will bless your efforts. (<a>Matt. 6:33</a>) Jehovah is not stumped when you face a job loss or an unexpected economic downturn.—<a>Isa. 59:1</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 1/15 2:5, 6</a></desc></text>

Although Jehovah has declared his anointed ones righteous as sons and the other sheep righteous as friends on the basis of Christ’s ransom sacrifice, personal differences will arise as long as any of us are alive on earth in this system of things. (<a>Rom. 5:9;</a><a>&#160;Jas. 2:23</a>) Otherwise there would have been no need for the inspired advice for us to continue “putting up with one another.” How is unity with fellow believers achieved? We need to develop “complete lowliness of mind and mildness.” (<a>Eph. 4:1, 2</a>) Applying this counsel involves yielding to the influence of God’s spirit and allowing it to produce its fruitage in us. That fruitage mends rifts between individuals, in contrast with the works of the flesh, which are always divisive. <a><i>w12</i> 7/15 4:6, 7</a></desc></text>

In fact, Satan is waging war on the anointed remnant. (<a>Rev. 12:17</a>) Those stalwart Christians have spearheaded the modern-day Kingdom-preaching work and have exposed Satan as the ruler of this world. The Devil also has no love for the “other sheep,” who support the anointed and are in line for everlasting life—a prospect that Satan no longer has. (<a>John 10:16</a>) No wonder he is wrathful! Whether we have the heavenly hope or the earthly hope, Satan certainly has no interest in our welfare. His goal is to make us his victims. (<a>1 Pet. 5:8</a>) To accomplish his aim, Satan has set various traps, or snares. Since he “has blinded the minds” of unbelievers, they do not accept the good news and cannot see these traps. However, the Devil also ensnares some who have accepted the Kingdom message.—<a>2 Cor. 4:3, 4</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 8/15 4:1, 2</a></desc></text>

Spiritual “food at the proper time,” giving us a better understanding of Bible prophecies and teachings, has come not only from discourses but also through new publications released at conventions. (<a>Matt. 24:45</a>) Such releases are often tools that help sincere individuals appreciate Scriptural truths. Stimulating Bible-based dramas encourage both young and old to examine their motives and guard against the pressures exerted by the world’s ungodly thinking. The baptism talk likewise offers all of us an opportunity to review our priorities in life and to experience the joy of seeing others symbolize their dedication to Jehovah.

It is represented on earth by its ‘citizens,’ the remnant of anointed Christians. (<a>Phil. 3:20</a>) Although God’s people were outnumbered, misrepresented, opposed, and persecuted at the hands of attackers during World War I, true worship could not be crushed out of existence. There were “the remaining ones of the people,” that is, the anointed remnant who loyally refused to be “cut off from the city.” More attacks by the nations were yet to come against the anointed remnant and their loyal companions with an earthly hope. (<a>Rev. 12:17</a>) World War II is a proof of that. The integrity-keeping course of God’s faithful anointed Witnesses spurs on God’s servants today to endure whatever trials come their way, including opposition from unbelieving relatives, workmates, or schoolmates who ridicule them for their faith.—<a>1 Pet. 1:6, 7</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 2/15 3:4-7</a></desc></text>

(<a>1 Tim. 6:3</a>) Just as an artist’s sketch provides us with a general picture, ‘the pattern of truth’ provides a broad outline for us to perceive and follow what Jehovah requires of us. After taking in knowledge, we develop faith. But we should continue to grow in both respects. (<a>2 Thess. 1:3</a>) Growth involves a progressive series of changes. “To grow” means to increase, to enlarge. Thus, after baptism, we need to continue to develop our spirituality so that our growth does not become stunted. During our initial period of Bible study, we may quickly grow spiritually and then get baptized. In the following years, our continued spiritual growth may not be as noticeable. Nevertheless, we still need to grow in faith and knowledge “to a full-grown man, to the measure of stature that belongs to the fullness of the Christ.”—<a>Eph. 4:13</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 3/15 3:7-9</a></desc></text>

(<a>Gen. 3:15</a>) No other human has ever volunteered to shoulder such a heavy responsibility. From heaven, Jehovah voiced his complete trust in his Son. (<a>Luke 3:21, 22</a>) Jesus always practiced what he preached by letting his <i>“Yes</i> mean Yes.” (<a>Matt. 5:37</a>) He allowed nothing to sidetrack him from the commission he received from his Father to preach the good news of God’s Kingdom and to make disciples of all whom God drew to Jesus. (<a>John 6:44</a>) The Bible describes the extent of Jesus’ truthfulness in these well-known words: “No matter how many the promises of God are, they have become Yes by means of him.” (<a>2 Cor. 1:20</a>) Indeed, Jesus is the finest example of one who proved true to what he promised his Father. <a><i>w12</i> 10/15 4:3, 4</a></desc></text>

These brothers do not have the full insight that God does, but they aim to make their decision harmonize with the direction given in God’s Word under the guidance of holy spirit. Hence, what they decide in such matters after seeking Jehovah’s help in prayer will reflect his point of view. (<a>Matt. 18:18</a>) Here is where loyalty matters. Will you forgive and confirm your love for those judged to be repentant? (<a>2 Cor. 2:5-8</a>) This may not be easy, especially if you are a victim of the wrongdoing or are related to a victim. However, by placing your trust in Jehovah and his way of dealing with matters through the congregation, you will act wisely.

Foreigners in ancient Israel benefited from their close association with native Israelites. This reflected Jehovah’s thinking on the matter as expressed by the apostle Paul in today’s text. By means of the new covenant, the congregation of anointed Christians replaced literal Israel as the nation with whom God was to have a special relationship. It is therefore called “the Israel of God.” (<a>Gal. 6:16</a>) And as Paul explained, in this new nation, “there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, foreigner, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all things and in all.” (<a>Col. 3:11</a>) In that sense, then, there were to be no foreigners in the Christian congregation. <a><i>w12</i> 12/15 4:2-4</a></desc></text>

So can “the deceptive power of riches,” the mistaken belief that riches bring lasting happiness and security. (<a>Matt. 13:22</a>) The wrong view of money can lead to wrong actions. (<a>Prov. 28:20</a>) Promises of quick, easy money have enticed some to purchase lottery tickets or to pursue multilevel marketing schemes, even drawing in other members of the congregation.

Earlier in his ministry, Jesus had clearly identified why many would not receive him and put faith in him. (<a>John 5:39-44</a>) The nation of Israel had been anticipating the arrival of the Messiah for centuries. When Jesus began teaching, some individuals may have discerned from Daniel’s prophecy that the appointed time for Christ’s appearance had arrived. Months earlier when John the Baptizer came preaching, many were saying: “May he perhaps be the Christ?” (<a>Luke 3:15</a>) But those versed in the Law failed to accept Jesus as the Messiah.

And third, we walk in God’s name when we joyfully submit to his righteous standards, lest we bring reproach on our Father’s holy name. (<a>1 John 4:8;</a><a>&#160;5:3</a>) Are you determined to “walk in the name of Jehovah our God to time indefinite”? We have willingly come to know Jehovah.

Of course, no matter where we reside, foreigners live among us. That was also the case with the ancient Israelites, who by means of the Law covenant were in a special relationship with Jehovah God.

What prevented me from reaching out to serve as a ministerial servant? Did I make a real effort to put on the new personality? Am I the sort of person Jehovah wants in his new world?’ Instead of just worrying about such sobering questions, we want to use them to analyze ourselves and make sure that we are giving our best in Jehovah’s service.

<text date='09-12-2014'><date>Tuesday, December 9</date><script><i>Your word is truth.—</i><a><i>John 17:17</i></a><i>.</i></script><desc>In Biblical Hebrew, the term often translated “truth” pertains to something that is true, trustworthy, faithful, or factual. The Greek word rendered “truth” denotes that which conforms to fact or to what is proper and right. Jehovah has preserved spiritual truth and has made knowledge of it available to us in ever-increasing abundance. (<a>2 John 1, 2</a>) Our comprehension of the truth steadily becomes clearer, for “the path of the righteous ones is like the bright light that is getting lighter and lighter until the day is firmly established”! (<a>Prov. 4:18</a>) Of course, we fully agree with Jesus, who said in prayer to God the words of today’s text. God’s written Word contains “the truth of the good news,” which consists of the whole body of Christian teachings. (<a>Gal. 2:14</a>) In part, these include facts about Jehovah’s name, his sovereignty, Jesus’ ransom sacrifice, the resurrection, and the Kingdom. <a><i>w13</i> 2/15 1:17, 18</a></desc></text>

(<a>Phil. 4:6-9</a>) In Jehovah’s strength, we will withstand trials, not allowing troubling situations to be stumbling blocks. Sadly, over the years some have let the imperfections of others knock them out of the race for life. Differences in viewpoints in matters of conscience have become stumbling blocks for them. (<a>1 Cor. 8:12, 13</a>) If someone offends us, will we allow this to become a major issue? The Bible admonishes Christians to stop judging, to forgive others, and to avoid insisting on personal rights. (<a>Luke 6:37</a>) When you face a possible stumbling stone, ask yourself: ‘Am I judging others based on my own preferences? Knowing that my brothers are imperfect, will I let someone’s lack of perfection take me out of the race?’ Love for Jehovah can help us be resolved not to allow anything another human does hinder us from crossing the finish line. <a><i>w13</i> 3/15 1:18, 19</a></desc></text>

Jesus said that love is the identifying mark of true Christians. Our love extends beyond the brotherhood, though. We endeavor to show love toward those who are not related to us in the faith. This is something all of us can and should do. We also have a work to do. We have been given a precious gift—the knowledge of the truth. God expects us to share that knowledge with others. (<a>Matt. 28:19, 20</a>) Sharing the truth is, after all, a loving thing to do. Of course, circumstances differ from Christian to Christian. Not all can do the same in the ministry. Jehovah understands that. The important thing is to do <i>all</i> that we personally can. Thus we display unselfish love for God and for our neighbor. <a><i>w12</i> 12/15 2:11,</a><a>&#160;13, 14</a></desc></text>

When Greece was divided among the generals of Alexander the Great, however, efforts were made to unite Judah with Syria by such means as Greek religion and Hellenic culture. As a result, the Jews accepted the false teachings that the human soul is immortal and that there is an underworld place of torment. Although the righteous man Job did not have the Scriptures, he knew the truth about death. He also realized that Jehovah is a loving God who would have a yearning to resurrect him. (<a>Job 14:13-15</a>) Abraham too believed in the resurrection. (<a>Heb. 11:17-19</a>) Since it is impossible to resurrect someone who cannot die, those God-fearing men did not believe in the immortality of the human soul. God’s spirit undoubtedly helped Job and Abraham to understand the state of the dead and to exercise faith in the resurrection. <a><i>w13</i> 2/15 2:12-14</a></desc></text>

Evidently, he wanted to know more about <i>the person represented by the name</i>—facts that would convince God’s people that He really would deliver them. Moses’ concern was warranted, for the Israelites had been slaves for some time. They would likely wonder whether the God of their forefathers <i>could</i> deliver them. Indeed, some Israelites had even taken up the worship of Egyptian gods! (<a>Ezek. 20:7, 8</a>) How did Jehovah reply to Moses’ question? In part, he said: “This is what you are to say to the sons of Israel, ‘I SHALL PROVE TO BE has sent me to you.’” Then he added: “Jehovah the God of your forefathers . . . has sent me to you.” God revealed that he will become whatever he chooses to become so as to accomplish his purpose, that he will <i>always</i> prove true to his word.—<a>Ex. 3:14, 15</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 3/15 5:4, 5</a></desc></text>

Jehovah chose David to be Israel’s next king. Jonathan respected God’s decision and did all he could to ‘strengthen David’s hand,’ even to the point of risking his own life to stand up for David in front of Saul. Jonathan loyally told David: “You yourself will be king over Israel, and I myself shall become second to you.” (<a>1 Sam. 20:30-34;</a><a>&#160;23:16, 17</a>) It is no wonder that after Jonathan’s death, David expressed his sorrow and his love for him in a mournful song. (<a>2 Sam. 1:17,</a><a> 26</a>) Jonathan was completely submissive to the Sovereign, Jehovah, and he fully supported David as the anointed of God.

Even then, however, circumstances may take an unexpected turn. On rare occasions, for example, a mate may develop serious emotional problems or be disfellowshipped. What should a Christian do if his or her marriage bond seems hopelessly frayed? ‘Must I keep on trying to save my marriage no matter what happens?’ you might ask. Nobody can or should make such a decision for you. Yet, there are sound reasons for not giving up on a marital bond that is weakening. The godly man or woman who endures the trials of a difficult marriage for the sake of conscience is precious to God. (<a>1 Pet. 2:20</a>) By means of his Word and spirit, Jehovah will help a Christian who makes earnest efforts to strengthen a strained marriage. <a><i>w12</i> 5/15 2:10, 11</a></desc></text>

What does this strange beast represent? It has two horns, so it is a dual power. John was seeing the Anglo-American World Power in a special role. (<a>Rev. 13:11-15</a>) This wild beast promotes the making of an image of the wild beast. John wrote that the image of the beast would appear, disappear, and then rise again. That is exactly what happened to an organization promoted by Britain and the United States, one that was intended to unite and represent the world’s kingdoms. This organization appeared after World War I and was known as the League of Nations. It disappeared with the onset of World War II. During that war, God’s people declared that according to the prophecy in Revelation, the image of the wild beast would ascend again.

(<a>2 Thess. 2:3-7</a>) False teachers even adopted the Jewish tradition of not using God’s name. But would Jehovah allow his memorial name to be erased? Never! Granted, its exact pronunciation cannot now be determined, but the name has endured. Over time, it has appeared in various translations of the Bible, as well as in the writings of Bible scholars. As for God’s servants, the year 1931 was particularly noteworthy, for in that year the International Bible Students, as God’s people were then called, adopted the Scriptural name Jehovah’s Witnesses. (<a>Isa. 43:10-12</a>) They thus announced to the world that they were proud to be servants of the only true God, to be “a people for his name,” praising that name.—<a>Acts 15:14</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 3/15 5:14, 15</a></desc></text>

(<a>Matt. 6:33;</a><a>&#160;Eph. 4:28</a>) He does not want us to be falling asleep during meetings because of overwork or to be sitting in the Kingdom Hall worrying about money. Yet, many in the world around us believe that only by devoting themselves to making money can they have a secure future and take it easy later in life. They often push their children toward the same materialistic goal. Jesus showed that such thinking is unreasonable. (<a>Luke 12:15-21</a>) This may remind us of Gehazi, who thought he could indulge his greed while still maintaining his good standing with Jehovah. (<a>2 Ki. 5:20-27</a>) Resting our hope on our savings, investments, or ability to earn money in this system amounts to resting our hope on “the god of this system,” Satan.—<a>2 Cor. 4:4;</a><a>&#160;1 Tim. 6:17</a>. <a><i>w13</i> 1/15 3:13,</a><a>&#160;15</a></desc></text>

God’s friends grow spiritually through their sincere prayers and good association. (<a>Mal. 3:16</a>) Like a loving parent, Jehovah is attentive to our prayerful cries for help. Hence, we need to “persevere in prayer.” (<a>Rom. 12:12</a>) We cannot remain a full-grown Christian unless we have the help of God. The pressures of this system are too great to resist and overcome by ourselves. If we cease to persist in prayer, we cut ourselves off from the constant fund of strength that God is willing and able to supply.

How will it be “split at its middle” and become two mountains? Why does Jehovah refer to them as “my mountains”? (<a>Zech. 14:5</a>) In the Bible, mountains can represent kingdoms, or governments. Also, blessings and protection are associated with God’s mountain. (<a>Ps. 72:3;</a><a>&#160;Isa. 25:6, 7</a>) Thus, the mountain of the olive trees on which God stands to the east of earthly Jerusalem represents Jehovah’s universal sovereignty, his supreme rulership. What is indicated by the division of the mountain of the olive trees? The mountain, which is to the east of Jerusalem, splits in the sense that Jehovah establishes another rulership, a subsidiary one. This secondary rulership is the Messianic Kingdom in the hands of Jesus Christ. That is why Jehovah speaks of the two mountains that result from the splitting of “the Mount of Olives” as being “my mountains.”—<a>Zech. 14:4</a>, ftn. <a><i>w13</i> 2/15 3:8, 9</a></desc></text>

(1) Jehovah wants us to be selective about our associates. He wants to protect us morally and spiritually. (2) We are influenced for good or for bad by the people with whom we associate; that is simply a fact of life. The way the verses above are worded shows that Jehovah is appealing to our heart. How so? Notice that none of the verses are set out as rules, such as “you must not . . .” Rather, they are written as plain statements of truth.

Those who are not yet citizens of God’s Kingdom may condone homosexuality, consider pornography to be harmless fun, and think that adultery and divorce are purely personal matters. Kingdom citizens have abandoned such shortsighted, self-centered attitudes. Although many Christians formerly had an immoral lifestyle, they now view sex and marriage as gifts from God. They treasure Jehovah’s high standards and wholeheartedly agree that those who continue to engage in sexual misconduct are not worthy of being Kingdom citizens. (<a>1 Cor. 6:9-11</a>) However, they also recognize that the heart is treacherous. So they appreciate receiving specific warnings that help them to maintain high moral standards. <a><i>w12</i> 8/15 2:9</a></desc></text>

(<a>Gen. 28:10</a>) Perhaps he wondered: ‘How long will I be away? Will my uncle warmly welcome me and grant me a God-fearing wife?’ If Jacob had such anxieties, these no doubt melted away when Jehovah appeared to Jacob in a dream, saying: “Here I am with you and I will keep you in all the way you are going and I will return you to this ground, because <i>I am not going to leave you</i> until I have actually done what I have spoken to you.” (<a>Gen. 28:15</a>) How those kind words must have reassured and comforted Jacob!

As a result of this encounter, Saul humbly repented of his past course, got baptized, and accepted the special assignment given to him to bear witness about Jesus to the nations. Paul zealously spread the Kingdom message throughout Asia Minor and into Europe, establishing and revisiting many congregations. Paul continued to address Jesus as his “Lord,” acting in harmony with that expression until the end of his earthly life. (<a>Acts 22:6-16;</a><a>&#160;2 Cor. 4:5;</a><a>&#160;2 Tim. 4:8</a>) Paul was not like others of whom Jesus said: “Why, then, do you call me ‘Lord!

(<a>1 Sam. 24:4-7;</a><a>&#160;2 Sam. 12:13</a>) As Jesus explained, Jehovah treats us the way we treat others. “Stop judging that you may not be judged,” said Jesus, “for with what judgment you are judging, you will be judged; and with the measure that you are measuring out, they will measure out to you.” (<a>Matt. 7:1, 2</a>) What a relief it is to know that Jehovah will forgive our sins—even sins as serious as adultery or murder! He will do so if we have a <i>forgiving spirit,</i> if we <i>confess our sins</i> before him, and if we manifest a <i>changed attitude</i> toward our bad actions. “Seasons of refreshing” come from Jehovah when sinners <i>sincerely repent.</i>—<a>Acts 3:19</a>. <a><i>w12</i> 11/15 4:9, 10</a></desc></text>

Despite not knowing how long he would have to wait to see his hope realized, Abraham’s love for and devotion to Jehovah never wavered.

For example, the <i>Revised Standard Version</i> states in its preface: “The use of any proper name for the one and only God . . . is entirely inappropriate for the universal faith of the Christian Church.” Jehovah’s Witnesses, on the other hand, are proud to bear God’s name and to glorify it. (<a>Isa. 43:10</a>) Furthermore, we count it a privilege to understand the meaning of that name and the universal issue involving its sanctification. (<a>Matt. 6:9</a>) To know God’s name involves much more than merely being acquainted with the word “Jehovah.” It includes knowing Jehovah’s reputation, as well as his qualities, purpose, and activities as revealed in the Bible, such as his dealings with his servants.

Hence, Paul saw no need to control the faith of his brothers, and he had no desire to do so. He was confident that they were faithful Christians who wanted to do what was right.

Why, city lights make it almost impossible for us to see the light emanating from distant stars! Is this so because the lights from roads, stadiums, and buildings are stronger or more beautiful than starlight? No! This happens because city lights are closer to us and they interfere with what we can perceive of Jehovah’s creation. Similarly, if the wrong kind of glory were too close to our hearts, it could prevent us from appreciating and seeking the enduring glory that Jehovah is willing to bestow. <a><i>w13</i> 2/15 4:6,</a><a>&#160;8, 9</a></desc></text>

If you scrutinized your heart, would you find an improper feeling toward someone of the opposite sex, secret longings that God would not condone and that need to be removed?
